#Inclusion 

Strimzi welcomes contributions from the community both in code and defining the direction of the project.
There are no concrete rules for what features should or should not be added to Strimzi but we expect the community to guide this.

The goal of Strimzi is to enable the running and operating Kafka on Kubernetes effectively. 

Suggested features that would likely be of interest to Strimzi:

* Operators and/or container images for Apache Kafka components.
* Support and/or documentation for additional kubernetes distributions.
* Features to enhance the operation of Kafka on Kubernetes.

Suggested features that may be out of scope of Strimzi:

* Additional language clients and Kafka quick starts - the upstream Apache Kafka project is more suitable.
* Data streaming platforms.
* Vendor specific integrations especially those with a single implementation.

For some features the decision may be influenced by how well the feature integrates with Kubernetes.
An example could be a console for monitoring Kafka.
If this were kubernetes aware then it would be more suitable for Strimzi than if it was not.  

These are guidelines and the community is free to chose to implement a feature if it feels that it is right for the project.
Equally, these guidelines can, and will, evolve as the project does.
