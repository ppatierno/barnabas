== Installing Kubernetes and OpenShift cluster

The easiest way to get started with Kubernetes or OpenShift is using the `Minikube`, `Minishift` or `oc cluster up`
utilities. This section provides basic guidance on how to use them. More details are provided on the websites of
the tools themselves.

=== Kubernetes

In order to interact with a Kubernetes cluster the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[`kubectl`]
utility needs to be installed.

The easiest way to get a running Kubernetes cluster is using `Minikube`. `Minikube` can be downloaded and installed
from the https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/[Kubernetes website]. Once installed, it can be started
using:

[source]
minikube start

=== OpenShift

In order to interact with an OpenShift cluster, the https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[`oc`] utility is needed.

An OpenShift cluster can be started in two different ways. The `oc` utility can start a cluster locally using the
command:

[source]
oc cluster up

This command requires Docker to be installed. More information about this way can be found
https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md[here].

Another option is to use `Minishift`. `MiniShift` is an OpenShift installation within a VM. It can be downloaded and
installed from the https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/index.html[Minishift website]. Once installed,
`Minishift` can be started using the following command:

[source]
minishift start
