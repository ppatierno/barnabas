= Cluster Controller

The cluster controller is in charge of deploying a Kafka cluster alongside a Zookeeper ensemble. It's also able to deploy a
Kafka Connect cluster which connects to an existing Kafka cluster.

When the cluster controller is up and running, it starts to "watch" for ConfigMaps containing the Kafka or Kafka Connect
cluster configuration. Such ConfigMaps need to have a specific label which by default is `strimzi.io/kind=cluster` (as described later)
that can be changed through a corresponding environment variable.

When a new ConfigMap is created on the Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster, the controller gets the cluster configuration from
its `data` section and starts the creation process of a new cluster (Kafka or Kafka Connect). It's done creating a set
of Kubernetes/OpenShift resources needed for such a cluster, like StatefulSets, ConfigMaps, Services and so on.

Every time the ConfigMap is updated by the user with some changes in the `data` section, the controller executes a related updating
operation on the cluster (i.e. scale up/down, changing metrics configuration and so on). It means that some resources are 
patched or deleted and then re-created for reflecting the changes in the cluster configuration.
This might cause rolling update which might lead to service disruption.

Finally, if the ConfigMap is deleted, the controller starts to un-deploy the cluster deleting all the related Kubernets/OpenShift
resources.

== Reconciliation

When the controller is up and running, it reacts at all notifications received from the Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster related 
to the watched ConfigMaps when they are created, updated or deleted.

It could happen that the cluster controller isn't working properly and the related pod is restarted. In that scenario,
it could lose notifications about the cluster ConfigMaps; without any action there will be an inconsistent state comparing
the ConfigMaps and what is actually deployed in the Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster.

For fixing this kind of issues, a periodic reconciliation is executed by the cluster controller so that it can compare 
how the ConfigMaps look like (and if they exist) with the current cluster deployment in order to have a consistent state 
across all of them.

== Format of the cluster ConfigMap

By default, the controller watches for ConfigMaps having the label `strimzi.io/kind=cluster` in order to find and get
configuration for a Kafka or Kafka Connect cluster to deploy. The label is configurable through the `STRIMZI_CONFIGMAP_LABELS` 
environment variable.

In order to distinguish which "type" of cluster to deploy, Kafka or Kafka Connect, the controller checks the
`strimzi.io/type` label which can have the following values :

* `kafka`: the ConfigMap provides configuration for a Kafka cluster (with Zookeeper ensemble) deployment
* `kafka-connect`: the ConfigMap provides configuration for a Kafka Connect cluster deployment
* `kafka-connect-s2i`: the ConfigMap provides configuration for a Kafka Connect cluster deployment using Build and Source2Image
features (works only with OpenShift)

The `data` section of such ConfigMaps contains different keys depending on the "type" of deployment as described in the 
following paragraphs.

=== Kafka

In order to configure a Kafka cluster deployment, it's possible to specify the following fields in the `data` section of 
the related ConfigMap :

* `kafka-nodes`: number of Kafka broker nodes. Default is 3
* `kafka-image`: the Docker image to use for the Kafka brokers. Default is `strimzi/kafka:latest`
* `kafka-healthcheck-delay`: the initial delay for the liveness and readiness probes for each Kafka broker node. Default is 15
* `kafka-healthcheck-timeout`: the timeout on the liveness and readiness probes for each Kafka broker node. Default is 5
* `zookeeper-nodes`: number of Zookeeper nodes
* `zookeeper-image`: the Docker image to use for the Zookeeper nodes. Default is `strimzi/zookeeper:latest`
* `zookeeper-healthcheck-delay`: the initial delay for the liveness and readiness probes for each Zookeeper node. Default is 15
* `zookeeper-healthcheck-timeout`: the timeout on the liveness and readiness probes for each Zookeeper node. Default is 5
* `KAFKA_DEFAULT_REPLICATION_FACTOR`: the default replication factors for automatically created topics. It sets the 
`default.replication.factor` property in the properties configuration file used by Kafka broker nodes on startup. Default is 3
* `KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR`: the replication factor for the offsets topic. It sets the  
`offsets.topic.replication.factor` property in the properties configuration file used by Kafka broker nodes on startup. Default is 3
* `KAFKA_TRANSACTION_STATE_LOG_REPLICATION_FACTOR`: the replication factor for the transaction topic. It sets the 
`transaction.state.log.replication.factor` property in the properties configuration file used by Kafka broker nodes on startup. Default is 3
* `kafka-storage`: a JSON string representing the storage configuration for the Kafka broker nodes. See related section
* `zookeeper-storage`: a JSON string representing the storage configuration for the Zookeeper nodes. See related section
* `kafka-metrics-config`: a JSON string representing the JMX exporter configuration for exposing metrics from Kafka broker nodes.
 Removing this field means having no metrics exposed.
* `zookeeper-metrics-config`: a JSON string representing the JMX exporter configuration for exposing metrics from Zookeeper nodes.
 Removing this field means having no metrics exposed.

==== Storage

Kafka needs to save information like data logs (so received messages), consumer offsets and so on in some way; the same is true for 
Zookeeper about znodes children and values.
The Strimzi project allows to save such a data in an "ephemeral" way (using `emptyDir`) or in a "persistent-claim" way using persistent 
volumes.
It's possible to provide the storage configuration in the related ConfigMap using a JSON string as value for the 
`kafka-storage` and `zookeeper-storage` fields. It's important to mention that such a storage configuration can't be changed
when the cluster is up and running.

The JSON representation has a mandatory `type` field for specifying the type of storage to use ("ephemeral" or "persistent-claim").
In case of "persistent-claim" type the following fields can be provided as well :

* `size`: defines the size of the persistent volume claim (i.e 1Gi)
* `class` : the Kubernetes/OpenShift storage class to use for dynamic volume allocation
* `selector`: allows to select a specific persistent volume to use. It contains a `matchLabels` field which defines an 
inner JSON object with key:value representing labels for selecting such a volume.
* `delete-claim`: specifies if the persistent volume claim has to be deleted when the cluster is un-deployed. Default is `false`

The "ephemeral" storage is really simple to configure and the related JSON string is something like this.

.Ephemeral storage JSON
[source,json]
----
{ "type": "ephemeral" }

----

The "persistent" storage has some more parameters but other than `type`, the `size` is the only mandatory one.

.Persistent storage JSON with 1Gi as size
[source,json]
----
{ "type": "persistent-claim", "size": "1Gi" }
----

A more complex configuration could use a storage class in the following way.

.Persistent storage JSON using "storage class"
[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "persistent-claim",
  "size": "1Gi",
  "class": "my-storage-class"
}
----

Finally, a selector can be used in order to select a specific labeled persistent volume which provides some needed features (i.e. an SSD)

.Persistent storage JSON with "match labels" selector
[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "persistent-claim",
  "size": "1Gi",
  "selector":
  {
    "matchLabels":
    {
      "hdd-type": "ssd"
    }
  },
  "delete-claim": "true"
}
----

==== Metrics

Because the Strimzi project uses the [JMX exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter) in order to expose metrics 
on each node, the JSON string used for metrics configuration in the cluster ConfigMap reflects the related JMX exporter 
configuration file. For this reason, you can find more information on how to use it in the corresponding GitHub repo.

For more information on how metrics work, the related documentation is available link:../metrics/Metrics.MD[here]

=== Kafka Connect

In order to configure a Kafka Connect cluster deployment, it's possible to specify the following fields in the `data` section of 
the related ConfigMap :

* `nodes`: number of Kafka Connect worker nodes. Default is 1
* `image`: the Docker image to use for the Kafka Connect workers. Default is `strimzi/kafka-connect:latest`. If S2I is used 
(only on OpenShift), then it should be the related S2I image.
* `healthcheck-delay`: the initial delay for the liveness and readiness probes for each Kafka Connect worker node. Default is 60
* `healthcheck-timeout`: the timeout on the liveness and readiness probes for each Kafka Connect worker node. Default is 5
* `KAFKA_CONNECT_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`: a list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster.
It sets the `bootstrap.servers` property in the properties configuration file used by Kafka Connect worker nodes on startup.
Default is `my-cluster-kafka:9092`
* `KAFKA_CONNECT_GROUP_ID`: a unique string that identifies the Connect cluster group this worker belongs to.
It sets the `group.id` property in the properties configuration file used by Kafka Connect worker nodes on startup.
Default is `my-connect-cluster`
* `KAFKA_CONNECT_KEY_CONVERTER`: converter class used to convert keys between Kafka Connect format and the serialized form 
that is written to Kafka. It sets the `key.converter` property in the properties configuration file used by Kafka Connect 
worker nodes on startup. Default is `org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter`
* `KAFKA_CONNECT_KEY_CONVERTER_SCHEMAS_ENABLE`: if Kafka Connect transformation on keys are with or without schemas.
It sets the `key.converter.schemas.enable` property in the properties configuration file used by Kafka Connect worker nodes on startup.
Default is true
* `KAFKA_CONNECT_VALUE_CONVERTER`: converter class used to convert values between Kafka Connect format and the serialized form 
that is written to Kafka. It sets the `value.converter` property in the properties configuration file used by Kafka Connect 
worker nodes on startup. Default is `org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter`
* `KAFKA_CONNECT_VALUE_CONVERTER_SCHEMAS_ENABLE`: if Kafka Connect transformation on values are with or without schemas.
It sets the `value.converter.schemas.enable` property in the properties configuration file used by Kafka Connect worker nodes on startup.
Default is true
* `KAFKA_CONNECT_CONFIG_STORAGE_REPLICATION_FACTOR`: replication factor used when creating the configuration storage topic.
It sets the `config.storage.replication.factor` property in the properties configuration file used by Kafka Connect worker nodes on startup.
Default is 3
* `KAFKA_CONNECT_OFFSET_STORAGE_REPLICATION_FACTOR`: replication factor used when creating the offset storage topic.
It sets the `offset.storage.replication.factor` property in the properties configuration file used by Kafka Connect worker nodes on startup.
Default is 3
* `KAFKA_CONNECT_STATUS_STORAGE_REPLICATION_FACTOR`: replication factor used when creating the status storage topic.
It sets the `status.storage.replication.factor` property in the properties configuration file used by Kafka Connect worker nodes on startup.
Default is 3
