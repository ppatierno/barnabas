= Kafka Exporter

You can configure the `Kafka` resource to automatically deploy Kafka Exporter in your cluster.

Kafka Exporter extracts data for analysis as Prometheus metrics, primarily data relating to offsets, consumer groups, consumer lag and topics.

For information on setting up Kafka Exporter and why it is important to monitor consumer lag for performance, see link:{BookURLDeploying}#assembly-metrics-kafka-exporter-str[Kafka Exporter] in the _Deploying Strimzi_ guide.
