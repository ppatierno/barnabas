= Kafka Connect cluster configuration

This section describes how to configure a Kafka Connect deployment in your Strimzi cluster.

Kafka Connect is an integration toolkit for streaming data between Kafka brokers and other systems using connector plugins.
Kafka Connect provides a framework for integrating Kafka with an external data source or target, such as a database, for import or export of data using connectors.
Connectors are plugins that provide the connection configuration needed.
The full schema of the `KafkaConnect` resource is described in xref:type-KafkaConnect-reference[].
