= JMX Options

Strimzi supports obtaining JMX metrics from the Kafka brokers by opening a JMX port on 9999.
You can obtain various metrics about each Kafka broker, for example, usage data such as the `BytesPerSecond` value
or the request rate of the network of the broker.
Strimzi supports opening a password and username protected JMX port or a non-protected JMX port.
