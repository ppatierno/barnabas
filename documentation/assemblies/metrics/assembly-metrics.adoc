= Introducing Metrics to Kafka

This section describes setup options for monitoring your Strimzi deployment.

Depending on your requirements, you can:

* xref:assembly-metrics-setup-{context}[Set up and deploy Prometheus and Grafana]
* xref:assembly-kafka-exporter-{context}[Configure the `Kafka` resource to deploy Kafka Exporter with your Kafka cluster]

When you have Prometheus and Grafana enabled, Kafka Exporter provides additional monitoring related to consumer lag.

Additionally, you can configure your deployment to track messages end-to-end by link:{BookURLUsing}#assembly-distributed-tracing-str[setting up distributed tracing^] as described in the _Using Strimzi_ guide.
