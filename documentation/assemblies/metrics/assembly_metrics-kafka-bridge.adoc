= Monitor Kafka Bridge

If you are already using Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring of built-in Kafka metrics, you can configure Prometheus to also scrape the Kafka Bridge Prometheus endpoint.

The example Grafana dashboard for the Kafka Bridge provides:

* Information about HTTP connections and related requests to the different endpoints
* Information about the Kafka consumers and producers used by the bridge
* JVM metrics from the bridge itself
