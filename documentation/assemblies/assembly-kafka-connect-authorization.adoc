= Kafka Connect user authorization

If authorization is enabled for Kafka Connect, the Kafka Connect user must be configured to provide read/write access rights to the Kafka Connect consumer group and
internal topics.

The properties for the consumer group and internal topics are automatically configured by Strimzi, or they can be specified explicitly in the `spec` for the `KafkaConnect` or `KafkaConnectS2I` configuration.

The following example shows the configuration of the properties in the `KafkaConnect` resource, which need to be represented in the Kafka Connect user configuration.
