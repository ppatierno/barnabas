= Using the Topic Operator

When you create, modify or delete a topic using the `KafkaTopic` resource,
the Topic Operator ensures those changes are reflected in the Kafka cluster.

The _Deploying Strimzi_ guide provides instructions to deploy the Topic Operator:

* link:{BookURLDeploying}#deploying-the-topic-operator-standalone-{context}[Standalone to operate with Kafka clusters not managed by Strimzi^]
