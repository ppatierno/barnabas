= Using the Cluster Operator

The Cluster Operator is used to deploy a Kafka cluster and other Kafka components.

The Cluster Operator is deployed using YAML installation files.

For information on deploying the Cluster Operator, see link:{BookURLDeploying}#cluster-operator-str[Deploying the Cluster Operator^] in the _Deploying Strimzi_ guide.

For information on the deployment options available for Kafka, see xref:assembly-deployment-configuration-kafka-str[Kafka Cluster configuration].

NOTE: On OpenShift, a Kafka Connect deployment can incorporate a Source2Image feature to provide a convenient way to add additional connectors.
