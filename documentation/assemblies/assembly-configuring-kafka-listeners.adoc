= Kafka broker listeners

You can configure the listeners enabled in Kafka brokers.
The following types of listeners are supported:

* Plain listener on port 9092 (without TLS encryption)
* TLS listener on port 9093 (with TLS encryption)
* External listener on port 9094 for access from outside of Kubernetes

.{oauth}
If you are using {oauth} token-based authentication, you can configure the listeners to connect to your authorization server.
For more information, see xref:assembly-oauth-authentication_str[Using {oauth} token-based authentication].

.Listener certificates
You can provide your own server certificates, called _Kafka listener certificates_, for TLS listeners or external listeners which have TLS encryption enabled. 
For more information, see xref:kafka-listener-certificates-str[].
