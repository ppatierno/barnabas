= Using the User Operator

When you create, modify or delete a user using the `KafkaUser` resource,
the User Operator ensures those changes are reflected in the Kafka cluster.

The _Deploying Strimzi_ guide provides instructions to deploy the User Operator:

* link:{BookURLDeploying}#deploying-the-user-operator-standalone-{context}[Standalone to operate with Kafka clusters not managed by Strimzi^]
