= ZooKeeper configuration

Strimzi allows you to customize the configuration of Apache ZooKeeper nodes.
You can specify and configure most of the options listed in the {ApacheZookeeperConfig}.

Options which cannot be configured are those related to the following areas:

* Security (Encryption, Authentication, and Authorization)
* Listener configuration
* Configuration of data directories
* ZooKeeper cluster composition

These options are automatically configured by Strimzi.
