= Setting up tracing for MirrorMaker, Kafka Connect, and the Kafka Bridge

Distributed tracing is supported for MirrorMaker, Kafka Connect (including Kafka Connect with Source2Image support), and the {ProductName} Kafka Bridge.

.Tracing in MirrorMaker

For MirrorMaker, messages are traced from the source cluster to the target cluster; the trace data records messages entering and leaving the MirrorMaker component.

.Tracing in Kafka Connect

Only messages produced and consumed by Kafka Connect itself are traced. To trace messages sent between Kafka Connect and external systems, you must configure tracing in the connectors for those systems. For more information, see xref:assembly-deployment-configuration-kafka-connect-{context}[].

.Tracing in the Kafka Bridge

Messages produced and consumed by the Kafka Bridge are traced. Incoming HTTP requests from client applications to send and receive messages through the Kafka Bridge are also traced.
In order to have end-to-end tracing, you must configure tracing in your HTTP clients.
