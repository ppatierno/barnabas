= Kafka MirrorMaker

The Cluster Operator deploys one or more Kafka MirrorMaker replicas to replicate data between Kafka clusters.
This process is called mirroring to avoid confusion with the Kafka partitions replication concept.
The MirrorMaker consumes messages from the source cluster and republishes those messages to the target cluster.

For information about example resources and the format for deploying Kafka MirrorMaker, see xref:assembly-deployment-configuration-kafka-mirror-maker-str[Kafka MirrorMaker configuration].
