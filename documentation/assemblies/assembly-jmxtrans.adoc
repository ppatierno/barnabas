= Retrieving JMX metrics with JMXTrans

JmxTrans is a way of retrieving JMX metrics data from Java processes and pushing that data in various formats to remote sinks inside or outside of the cluster.
JmxTrans can communicate with a secure JMX port.
Strimzi supports using JmxTrans to read JMX data from Kafka brokers.
