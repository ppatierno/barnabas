= Kafka MirrorMaker configuration

This chapter describes how to configure a Kafka MirrorMaker deployment in your Strimzi cluster to replicate data between Kafka clusters.

You can use Strimzi with MirrorMaker or xref:assembly-mirrormaker-str[MirrorMaker 2.0].
MirrorMaker 2.0 is the latest version, and offers a more efficient way to mirror data between Kafka clusters.

If you are using MirrorMaker, you configure the `KafkaMirrorMaker` resource.

The following procedure shows how the resource is configured:

* xref:configuring-kafka-mirror-maker-{context}[Configuring Kafka MirrorMaker]

The full schema of the `KafkaMirrorMaker` resource is described in the xref:type-KafkaMirrorMaker-reference[KafkaMirrorMaker schema reference].

NOTE: Labels applied to a `KafkaMirrorMaker` resource are also applied to the Kubernetes resources comprising Kafka MirrorMaker.
This provides a convenient mechanism for resources to be labeled as required.
