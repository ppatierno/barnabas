= Strimzi custom resource upgrades

When upgrading Strimzi to {ProductVersion} from {ConvertAfterProductVersion} or earlier, you must ensure that your custom resources are using API version `{ApiVersion}`.
You have to upgrade the Custom Resource Definitions and the Custom Resources before upgrading to Strimzi {ConvertBeforeProductVersion} or newer.
To do the upgrade, you can use the _API conversion tool_ from Strimzi {LastReleaseWithCRDUpgrade}.
For more information, see the {UpgradeGuide}.
