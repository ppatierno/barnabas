= Strimzi resource upgrades

The `{KafkaApiVersionPrev}` API version is deprecated for the following Strimzi resources:

* `Kafka`
* `KafkaConnect`
* `KafkaConnectS2I`
* `KafkaMirrorMaker`
* `KafkaTopic`
* `KafkaUser`

Update these resources to use the `{KafkaApiVersion}` API version.

This section describes the upgrade steps for the resources.

IMPORTANT: The upgrade of resources _must_ be performed after xref:assembly-upgrade-{context}[upgrading the Cluster Operator], so the Cluster Operator can understand the resources.

.What if the resource upgrade does not take effect?
If the upgrade does not take effect, a warning is given in the logs on reconciliation to indicate that the resource cannot be updated until the `apiVersion` is updated.

To trigger the update, make a cosmetic change to the custom resource, such as adding an annotation.

Example annotation:

[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
metadata:
  # ...
  annotations:
    upgrade: "Upgraded to {KafkaApiVersion}"
----

The following procedures describe the steps to update specific resources to use the `{KafkaApiVersion}` API version:

* xref:proc-upgrade-kafka-resources-{context}[]
* xref:proc-upgrade-kafka-connect-resources-{context}[]
* xref:proc-upgrade-kafka-connect-s2i-resources-{context}[]
* xref:proc-upgrade-kafka-mirror-maker-resources-{context}[]
* xref:proc-upgrade-kafka-topic-resources-{context}[]
* xref:proc-upgrade-kafka-user-resources-{context}[]
