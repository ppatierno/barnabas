= Upgrading Strimzi

Strimzi can be upgraded without causing any downtime for consumers and producers. 
Cluster availability might be affected by rolling updates that occur during the upgrade process.

Each version of Strimzi supports one or more versions of Apache Kafka.
You can upgrade to a higher Kafka version as long as it is supported by your version of Strimzi.
In some cases, you can also downgrade to a lower supported Kafka version.

Newer versions of Strimzi may support newer versions of Kafka, but you need to upgrade Strimzi _before_ you can upgrade to a higher supported Kafka version.
