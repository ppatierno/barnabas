= Upgrading Strimzi

Strimzi can be upgraded with no cluster downtime.
Each version of Strimzi supports one or more versions of Apache Kafka.
You can upgrade to a higher Kafka version as long as it is supported by your version of Strimzi.
In some cases, you can also downgrade to a lower supported Kafka version.

Newer versions of Strimzi may support newer versions of Kafka, but you need to upgrade Strimzi _before_ you can upgrade to a higher supported Kafka version.

IMPORTANT: If applicable, xref:assembly-upgrade-resources-{context}[Resource upgrades] _must_ be performed after upgrading Strimzi and Kafka.
