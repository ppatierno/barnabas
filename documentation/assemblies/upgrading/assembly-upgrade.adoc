= Upgrading Strimzi

Strimzi can be upgraded from a given version to a later version to take advantage of new features and enhancements, performance improvements, and security options.

As part of the upgrade, you upgrade Kafka to a later supported version. 
Each Kafka release introduces new features, improvements, and bug fixes to your Strimzi deployment.

Strimzi can be xref:assembly-downgrade-{context}[downgraded] to the previous version if you encounter issues with a newer version.

.Upgrade paths

Two upgrade paths are possible:

Incremental:: 
Upgrading Strimzi from the current version to the next version.
+
For example, upgrading from Strimzi 0.20.1 to 0.21.0.

Multi-version::
Upgrading Strimzi from the current version to any later version within a single upgrade (skipping one or more versions).
+
For example, upgrading from Strimzi 0.19.0 directly to Strimzi 0.21.0.

.Kafka version support

You can review supported Kafka versions in the link:https://strimzi.io/downloads/[Supported versions^] table.

* The *Operators* column lists all released Strimzi versions (the Strimzi version is often called the "Operator version"). 

* The *Kafka versions* column lists the Kafka versions that are supported by each Strimzi version. 

//When upgrading to an Operator version that drops support for the Kafka version you are upgrading from, the upgraded Cluster Operator returns an error message, for example:

//[source]
//Version 2.4.0 is not supported. Supported versions are: 2.5.0, 2.5.1, 2.6.0, 2.7.0.

//You can upgrade to a supported Kafka version when upgrading the brokers, you change the `spec.Kafka.version` in the Kafka custom resource to a later Kafka version that is supported by the new Operator version.

.Downtime and availability

If topics are configured for high availability, upgrading Strimzi should not cause any downtime for consumers and producers that publish and read data from those topics. 
Highly available topics have a replication factor of at least 3 and partitions distributed evenly among the brokers.

Upgrading Strimzi triggers rolling updates, where all brokers are restarted in turn, at different stages of the process. 
During rolling updates, not all brokers are online, so overall _cluster availability_ is temporarily reduced.  
A reduction in cluster availability increases the chance that a broker failure will result in lost messages.

.Kafka version compatibility

You can upgrade to a later Kafka version as long as it is supported by your version of Strimzi.
In some cases, you can also downgrade to a previous supported Kafka version.
