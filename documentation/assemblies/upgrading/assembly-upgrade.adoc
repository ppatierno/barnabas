= Upgrading Strimzi

Strimzi can be upgraded from a lower version to a higher version to take advantage of new features and enhancements, performance improvements, and security options. 
By upgrading to the latest Strimzi version you gain access to the features shipped in the higher supported Kafka versions.

.Downtime and availability

If topics are configured for high availability, upgrading should not cause any downtime for the consumers and producers that publish and read data from them. 
Highly available topics have a replication factor of at least 3, with partitions distributed evenly across the brokers.

The Strimzi upgrade process involves rolling updates, which can affect _cluster availability_. 
The rolling updates cause brokers to restart. 
Overall cluster availability is reduced when one or more brokers in a cluster are down, increasing the chance that a broker failure will result in messages being lost.

.Kafka version compatibility

Each version of Strimzi supports one or more versions of Apache Kafka.
You can upgrade to a higher Kafka version as long as it is supported by your version of Strimzi.
In some cases, you can also downgrade to a lower supported Kafka version.

Newer versions of Strimzi may support newer versions of Kafka, but you need to upgrade Strimzi _before_ you can upgrade to a higher supported Kafka version.
