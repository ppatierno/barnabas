= Logging

Logging enables you to diagnose error and performance issues for {ProductName}.
For the logging, various logger implementations are used.

* `log4j` logger for Kafka and Zookeeper
* `log4j2` logger for Topic Operator, User Operator, and other components

This section provides information about setting loggers and describes how to configure log levels.

You can set the log levels by specifying the loggers and their levels directly (inline) or by using a custom (external) config map.

include::ref-kafka-logging.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

It is also possible to enable and disable garbage collector (GC) logging, for more information see xref:ref-jvm-options-{context}[]
