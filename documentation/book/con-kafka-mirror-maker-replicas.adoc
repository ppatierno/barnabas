= Replicas

Use the `replicas` property to configure replicas.

You can run multiple Mirror Maker replicas to provide better availability and scalability.
When running Kafka Mirror Maker on Kubernetes it is not absolutely necessary to run multiple replicas of the Kafka Mirror Maker for high availability.
When the node where the Kafka Mirror Maker has deployed crashes, Kubernetes will automatically reschedule the Kafka Mirror Maker pod to a different node.
However, running Kafka Mirror Maker with multiple replicas can provide faster failover times as the other nodes will be up and running.
