= {ProductName} and Kafka upgrades

Each version of {ProductName} supports a range of versions of Apache Kafka.
You can upgrade to a higher Kafka version as long as that version is supported by your version of {ProductName}.
In some cases, you can also downgrade to a lower supported Kafka version.

When a newer version of {ProductName} is available, it may provide support for newer versions of Kafka. 
Therefore, you will need to upgrade to the new version of {ProductName} before you can upgrade to a higher supported Kafka version.
Upgrading the version of {ProductName} is done by upgrading the Cluster Operator deployment to the new version.
