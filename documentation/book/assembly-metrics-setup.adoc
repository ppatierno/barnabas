= Metrics

This section describes how to monitor {ProductName} Kafka and ZooKeeper clusters using Prometheus to provide monitoring data for the example Grafana dashboards.

In order to run the example Grafana dashboards, you must:

. xref:assembly-metrics-kafka-{context}[Add metrics configuration to your Kafka cluster resource]
. xref:assembly-metrics-prometheus-{context}[Deploy Prometheus and Prometheus Alertmanager]
. xref:assembly-configuring-grafana-{context}[Deploy Grafana]

WARNING: The resources referenced in this section are intended as a starting point for setting up monitoring, but they are provided as examples only.
If you require further support on configuring and running Prometheus or Grafana in production, try reaching out to their respective communities.

.Using metrics with `minikube` or `minishift`
When adding Prometheus and Grafana servers to an Apache Kafka deployment using `minikube` or `minishift`, the memory available to the virtual machine should be increased (to 4 GB of RAM, for example, instead of the default 2 GB). Information on how to increase the default amount of memory can be found in the following section <<installing_kubernetes_and_openshift_cluster>>.
