= TLS connections

== Zookeeper communication

Zookeeper does not support TLS itself. 
By deploying a TLS sidecar within every Zookeeper pod, the Cluster Operator is able to provide data encryption and authentication between Zookeeper nodes in a cluster.
Zookeeper only communicates with the TLS sidecar over the loopback interface.
The TLS sidecar then proxies all Zookeeper traffic, TLS decrypting data upon entry into a Zookeeper pod, and TLS encrypting data upon departure from a Zookeeper pod.

This TLS encrypting `stunnel` proxy is instantiated from the `spec.zookeeper.stunnelImage` specified in the Kafka resource.

== Kafka interbroker communication

Communication between Kafka brokers is done through an internal listener on port 9091, which is encrypted by default and not accessible to Kafka clients.

Communication between Kafka brokers and Zookeeper nodes uses a TLS sidecar, as described above.

== Topic and User Operators

Like the Cluster Operator, the Topic and User Operators each use a TLS sidecar when communicating with Zookeeper. The Topic Operator connects to Kafka brokers on port 9091.

== Kafka Client connections

Encrypted communication between Kafka brokers and clients running within the same Kubernetes cluster can be provided by configuring the `spec.kafka.listeners.tls` listener, which listens on port 9093.

Encrypted communication between Kafka brokers and clients running outside the same Kubernetes cluster can be provided by configuring the `spec.kafka.listeners.external` listener (the port of the `external` listener depends on its type).

NOTE: Unencrypted client communication with brokers can be configured by `spec.kafka.listeners.plain`, which listens on port 9092.
