= Enabling Grafana dashboard examples

Set up a Prometheus data source and example dashboards to enable Grafana for monitoring.

Example dashboards are provided with {ProductName} as JSON files:

* https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/blob/{GithubVersion}/metrics/examples/grafana/strimzi-kafka.json[`strimzi-kafka.json`]
* https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/blob/{GithubVersion}/metrics/examples/grafana/strimzi-zookeeper.json[`strimzi-zookeeper.json`].

The dashboards are a good starting point for monitoring key metrics for Kafka and ZooKeeper clusters, but they do not represent all the metrics available.

Depending on your infrastructure you may need to modify or add to them.

NOTE: No alert notification rules are defined.

When accessing the dashboard, you can use the `port-forward` command for forwarding traffic from the Grafana pod to the host.

For example, you can access the Grafana user interface by running `{cmdcli} port-forward grafana-1-fbl7s 3000:3000` and then pointing a browser to `http://localhost:3000`.

.Procedure

. Access the Grafana user interface using `admin/admin` credentials.

On the initial view choose to reset the password.

. Add Prometheus as a data source.
+
* Specifying a name
* Add _Prometheus_ as the type.
* Specify the connection string to the Prometheus server (`http://prometheus-operated:9090`) in the URL field

. Click _Add_ to test the connection to the data source.

. Click _Dashboards_, then _Import_ to open the _Import Dashboard_ window and import the example dashboards (or paste the JSON).

After importing the dashboards, the Grafana dashboard homepage will list two dashboards for you to choose from.  After your Prometheus server has been collecting metrics for a {ProductName} cluster for some time you should see a populated dashboard such as the examples shown below.
