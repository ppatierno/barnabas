= Customizing Containers

You can set custom environment variables for Kafka broker containers by using the `kafkaContainer` template property in `Kafka.spec.kafka`.

These environment variables are defined under the `env` field as a list of objects with `name` and `value` fields.
The following example shows two custom environment variables set for a Kafka broker:

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
# ...
spec:
    kafka:
        template:
            kafkaContainer:
                env:
                    - name: TEST_ENV_1
                      value: test.env.one
                    - name: TEST_ENV_2
                      value: test.env.two
# ...
----

Environment variables prefixed with `KAFKA_` are internal to {ProductName} and should be avoided.
If you set a custom environment variable that is already in use by {ProductName}, it is ignored and a warning is recorded in the log.
