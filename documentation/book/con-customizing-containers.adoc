= Customizing Containers

Using the `kafkaContainer` template field you can set environment variables to be applied to the Kafka broker containers.

Environment variables should be supplied under the `env` field as a list of objects with `name` and `value` fields. 
The following example shows two custom environment variables being set for the Kafka broker:

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
# ...
spec:
    kafka:
        template:
            kafkaContainer:
                env:
                    - name: TEST_ENV_1
                      value: test.env.one
                    - name: TEST_ENV_2
                      value: test.env.two
# ...
----

Environment variables used internally by Strimzi typically (although not always) begin with the `KAFKA_` prefix and should be avoided. 
If an environment variable is set that is already in use by Strimzi then it will be ignored and a warning will be posted in the log output.
