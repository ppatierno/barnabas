= {ProductName} custom resource status

The `status` property of a {ProductName} custom resource publishes useful information about the resource to users and tools that need it.

Several resources have a `status` property, as described in the following table.

[cols="2*",options="header",stripes="none",separator=¦]
|===

¦{ProductName} Resource
¦Publishes information on...

m¦xref:type-KafkaStatus-reference[]
¦The Kafka cluster.

m¦xref:type-KafkaConnectStatus-reference[]
¦The Kafka Connect cluster, if deployed.

m¦xref:type-KafkaConnectS2Istatus-reference[]
¦The Kafka Connect cluster with Source-to-Image support, if deployed.

m¦xref:type-KafkaMirrorMakerStatus-reference[]
¦The Kafka MirrorMaker tool, if deployed.

m¦xref:type-KafkaUserStatus-reference[]
¦Kafka users.

m¦xref:type-KafkaBridgeStatus-reference[]
¦The {ProductName} Kafka Bridge, if deployed.

//When dev work is complete, add `KafkaTopicStatus` to the above table. `KafkaTopicStatus`: Kafka topics and their partitions
The `status` property includes information on:

* The _current state_ of the resource described in _status conditions_

* The resource's last `observedGeneration` (the generation of the resource to which the status applies)

* Other information specific to the resource, for example the REST API endpoint for Kafka Connect connectors.

A resource's current state is useful for tracking progress related to the resource achieving its _desired state_, as defined by the `spec` property. The status conditions provide the time and reason the state of the resource changed and details of events preventing or delaying the operator from realizing the resource's desired state.

{ProductName} creates and maintains the status of custom resources, periodically evaluating the current state of the custom resource and updating its status accordingly.

When performing an update on a custom resource using `kubectl edit`, for example, its `status` is not editable. Moreover, changing the `status` would not affect the configuration of the Kafka cluster.

Here we see the `status` property specified for a Kafka custom resource.

<1> Status `conditions` describe criteria related to the status that cannot be deduced from the existing resource information, or are specific to the instance of a resource.
<2> The `Ready` condition indicates whether the Cluster Operator currently considers the Kafka cluster able to handle traffic.
<3> The `observedGeneration` indicates the generation of the `Kafka` custom resource that was last reconciled by the Cluster Operator.
<4> The `listeners` describe the current Kafka bootstrap addresses by type.
+
IMPORTANT: The status for `external` listeners is still under development and does not provide a specific IP address for external listeners of type `nodeport`.

NOTE: The Kafka bootstrap addresses listed in the status do not signify that those endpoints or the Kafka cluster is in a ready state.

.Accessing status information
You can access status information for a resource from the command line. For more information, see xref:proc-accessing-resource-status-{context}[].
