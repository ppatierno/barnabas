= Supported clients for the {ProductName} Kafka Bridge

You can use the Kafka Bridge to integrate the following two types of clients with your Kafka cluster:

* Container-based client applications running in _the same_ {ProductPlatformName} cluster as the Kafka Bridge itself. These are referred to as _internal clients_.

* Client applications running _outside_ the {ProductPlatformName} cluster in which the Kafka Bridge is deployed. These are referred to as _external clients_.

Internal clients can access the Kafka Bridge on the host and port defined in the `KafkaBridge` custom resource. External clients can access the Kafka Bridge by using an {OpenShiftName} route or a LoadBalancer service.

For more information on configuring the host and port for the `KafkaBridge` resource, see xref:ref-kafka-bridge-http-configuration-{context}[].
