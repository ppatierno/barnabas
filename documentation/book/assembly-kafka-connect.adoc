= Kafka Connect

link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect[Kafka Connect^], a core component of Apache Kafka, is a tool for streaming high volumes of data into and out of your Kafka cluster. It provides a framework for building connectors (a type of plug-in) for your Kafka cluster, a REST API for managing connectors, and more. Two built-in connectors are provided:

* A file source connector, named `FileStreamSourceConnector`.
* A file sink connector, named `FileStreamSinkConnector`.

These connectors transfer data into and out of a Kafka cluster by using external files for sending and receiving messages. Both connectors are available for use in {ProductName}.

You can use the Cluster Operator to deploy a Kafka Connect cluster to your {ProductPlatformName} cluster. The Kafka Connect cluster is implemented as a `Deployment` with a configurable number of workers. The REST API is available within your {ProductPlatformName} cluster on port 8083, as the `kafka-connect` service.
