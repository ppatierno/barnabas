[id='kafka-connect-{context}']
= Kafka Connect

The Cluster Operator deploys a link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect[Kafka Connect^] cluster, which can be used with your Kafka broker deployment.
It is implemented as a `Deployment` with a configurable number of workers.
The default image currently contains only the `FileStreamSinkConnector` and `FileStreamSourceConnector` connectors.
The REST interface for managing the Kafka Connect cluster is exposed internally within the {ProductPlatformName} cluster as a `kafka-connect` service on port `8083`.

Example `KafkaConnect` resources and the details about the `KafkaConnect` format for deploying Kafka Connect can be found in
xref:assembly-deployment-configuration-kafka-connect-str[Kafka Connect cluster configuration]
and
xref:assembly-deployment-configuration-kafka-connect-s2i-str[Kafka Connect cluster with Source2Image support].
