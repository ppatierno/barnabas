= Persistent storage

Persistent storage uses {K8sPersistentVolumeClaims} to provision persistent volumes for storing data.
Persistent Volume Claims can be used to provision volumes of many different types, depending on the {K8SStorageClass} which will provision the volume.
The data types which can be used with persistent volume claims include many types of SAN storage as well as {K8sLocalPersistentVolumes}.

To use persistent storage, the `type` has to be set to `persistent-claim`.
Persistent storage supports additional configuration options:

`size` (required)::
Defines the size of the persistent volume claim, for example, "1000Gi".

`class` (optional)::
The {ProductPlatformName} {K8SStorageClass} to use for dynamic volume provisioning.

`selector` (optional)::
Allows selecting a specific persistent volume to use.
It contains key:value pairs representing labels for selecting such a volume.

`deleteClaim` (optional)::
Boolean value which specifies if the Persistent Volume Claim has to be deleted when the cluster is undeployed.
Default is `false`.

WARNING: Resizing persistent storage for existing {ProductName} clusters is not currently supported.
You must decide the necessary storage size before deploying the cluster.

The following example demonstrates the use of a storage class.

storage:
  type: persistent-claim
  size: 1Gi

Finally, a `selector` can be used to select a specific labeled persistent volume to provide needed features such as an SSD.

.Persistent Volume Claim naming

When the persistent storage is used, it will create Persistent Volume Claims with the following names:

`data-_cluster-name_-kafka-_idx_`::
Persistent Volume Claim for the volume used for storing data for the Kafka broker pod `_idx_`.

`data-_cluster-name_-zookeeper-_idx_`::
Persistent Volume Claim for the volume used for storing data for the Zookeeper node pod `_idx_`.
