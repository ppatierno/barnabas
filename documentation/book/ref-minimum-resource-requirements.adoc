[id='cluster-operator-resource-requirements-{context}']
== Cluster Operator resource requirements

Testing has shown that the Cluster Operator functions adequately with 256Mi of memory and 200m CPU when watching two clusters.
It is therefore recommended to use these as a minimum when configuring resource requests and not to run it with lower limits than these.
Configuring more generous limits is recommended, especially when it is controlling multiple clusters.

[id='topic-operator-resource-requirements-{context}']
== Topic Operator resource requirements

Testing has shown that the topic operator functions adequately with 96Mi of memory and 100m CPU when watching two topics.
It is therefore recommended to use these as a minimum when configuring resource requests and not to run it with lower limits than these. 
If the Kafka cluster has more than a handful of topics more generous requests and limits will be necessary.
