= Extending Kafka Connect with plug-ins

At startup, Kafka Connect loads any third-party plug-ins, including connectors, contained in the `/opt/kafka/plugins` directory. You can add your own connectors to this directory in one of two ways:

* Create a Docker image from the Kafka Connect base image.
* Create a container image using {OpenShiftName} builds.
