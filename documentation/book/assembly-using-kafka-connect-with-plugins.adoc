= Using Kafka Connect with plugins

{ProductName} container images for Kafka Connect contain, by default, only the `FileStreamSinkConnector` and `FileStreamSourceConnector` connectors which are part of Apache Kafka.

To facilitate deployment with 3rd party connectors, Kafka Connect is configured to automatically load all plugins or connectors that are present in the `/opt/kafka/plugins` directory during startup.

There are two ways of adding custom plugins into this directory:

* Using a custom Docker image
* Using the {OpenShiftName} build system with the {ProductName} S2I
