= Extending Kafka Connect with plugins

{ProductName} container images for Kafka Connect contain, by default, only the `FileStreamSinkConnector` and `FileStreamSourceConnector` connectors which are part of Apache Kafka.

To facilitate deployment with 3rd party connectors, you have to add the connector plugins to the Kafka Connect container image.
There are two ways how to do that:

* Using a custom Docker image
* Using the {OpenShiftName} build system with the {ProductName} S2I
