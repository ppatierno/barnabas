= Maintenance time windows

Using maintenance time windows you can control when Kafka and Zookeeper clusters start rolling updates.
Rolling updates allow clusters updates to take place with zero downtime by incrementally updating pods instances with new ones.

IMPORTANT: Currently, maintenance time windows are only supported for CA certificates renewals.

The maintenance time windows are described by {CronExpressions}.
