= Maintenance time windows for rolling updates

Maintenance time windows allow you to schedule rolling updates of your Kafka and Zookeeper clusters to start at a convenient time.
During a rolling update, pod instances in a cluster are updated incrementally, with no downtime.

You configure a maintenance time window by entering an array of strings containing one or more {CronExpressions} in the `Kafka.spec.maintenanceTimeWindows` property.
The cron expressions must be expressed in UTC.
The following example shows a typical maintenance time window:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
# ...
maintenanceTimeWindows:
  - "* * 8-10 * * ?"
  - "* * 14-15 * * ?"
# ...
----

NOTE: Currently, maintenance time windows for rolling updates are only respected by the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate renewal process.
Other processes—for example, a rolling update triggered by configuring a Kafka cluster—do not respect maintenance time windows.
