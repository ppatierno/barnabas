= Kafka and Zookeeper storage

Kafka brokers and Zookeeper are stateful applications.
They need to store data on disks.
{ProductName} allows you to configure the type of storage, which they want to use for Kafka and Zookeeper.
Storage configuration is mandatory and has to be specified in every `Kafka` resource.

IMPORTANT: Once the Kafka cluster is deployed, the storage cannot be changed.
