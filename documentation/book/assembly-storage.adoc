[id='assembly-storage-{context}']
= Kafka and Zookeeper storage

Kafka brokers and Zookeeper are stateful applications.
They need to store data on disks.
{ProductName} allows you to configure the type of storage, which they want to use for Kafka and Zookeeper.
Storage configuration is mandatory and has to be specified in every `Kafka` resource.

Storage can be configured using the `storage` property in following resources:

* `Kafka.spec.kafka`
* `Kafka.spec.zookeeper`

{ProductName} supports two types of storage:

* Ephemeral
* Persistent

The type of storage is specified in the `type` field.

IMPORTANT: Once the Kafka cluster is deployed, the storage cannot be changed.
