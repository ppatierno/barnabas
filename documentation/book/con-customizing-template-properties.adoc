= Template properties

The `template` property allows you to configure selected aspects of how resources are created by {ProductName}.
The `template` property can be used in the following resources / properties:

* Kafka.spec.kafka
* Kafka.spec.zookeeper
* Kafka.spec.entityOperator
* KafkaConnect.spec
* KafkaConnectS2I.spec
* KafkaMirrorMakerSpec

The following example shows the `template` being used to modify labels of the Kafka broker `StatefulSet`:

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
  labels:
    app: my-cluster
spec:
  kafka:
    # ...
    template:
      statefulset:
        metadata:
          labels:
            mylabel: myvalue
    # ...
