[id='assembly-upgrade-resources-{context}']
= {ProductName} resource upgrades
For this release of {ProductName}, resources that use the API version `{KafkaApiVersionPrev}` must be updated to use `{KafkaApiVersion}`.

The `{KafkaApiVersionPrev}` API version is deprecated in release {ProductVersion}.

IMPORTANT: The upgrade of resources _must_ be performed after xref:assembly-upgrade-{context}[upgrading the Cluster Operator], so the Cluster Operator can understand the resources.
