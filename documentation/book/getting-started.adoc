= Getting started with {ProductName}

{ProductName} works on all types of clusters, from public and private clouds on to local deployments intended for development.
This guide expects that an {ProductPlatformName} cluster is available and the
ifdef::Kubernetes[`kubectl` and]
`oc` command-line tools are installed and configured to connect to the running cluster.

ifndef::Downloading[]
{ProductName} is based on Strimzi {StrimziVersion}. This chapter describes the procedures to deploy {ProductName} on {OpenShiftName} {OpenShiftVersion}. 
endif::Downloading[]

ifdef::InstallationAppendix[]
When no existing {ProductPlatformName} cluster is available, `Minikube` or `Minishift` can be used to create a local
cluster. More details can be found in xref:installing_kubernetes_and_openshift_cluster[Installing Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters].
endif::InstallationAppendix[]

NOTE: To run the commands in this guide, your
ifdef::Kubernetes[]
{KubernetesLongName} and
endif::Kubernetes[]
{OpenShiftLongName} user must have the rights to manage role-based access control (RBAC).

For more information about {OpenShiftName} and setting up {OpenShiftName} cluster, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.9/welcome/index.html[OpenShift documentation].
