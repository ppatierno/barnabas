{ProductName} runs on
ifdef::Kubernetes[{KubernetesLongName} {KubernetesVersion} and]
{OpenShiftLongName} {OpenShiftVersion}.

{ProductName} works on all kinds of clusters - from public and private clouds down to local deployments intended for development.
This guide expects that an {ProductPlatformName} cluster is available and the
ifdef::Kubernetes[`kubectl` and]
`oc` command-line tools are installed and configured to connect to the running cluster.

ifdef::InstallationAppendix[]
When no existing {ProductPlatformName} cluster is available, `Minikube` or `Minishift` can be used to create a local
cluster. More details can be found in xref:installing_kubernetes_and_openshift_cluster[Installing Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters].
endif::InstallationAppendix[]

[NOTE]
To run the commands in this guide, your
ifdef::Kubernetes[{KubernetesLongName} and]
{OpenShiftLongName} user must have the rights to manage role-based access control (RBAC).
