{ProductName} runs on
ifdef::Kubernetes[{KubernetesLongName} {KubernetesVersion} and]
{OpenShiftLongName} {OpenShiftVersion}.

{ProductName} works on all kinds of clusters - from public and private clouds down to local deployments intended for development.
This guide expects that an {ProductPlatformName} cluster is available and the
ifdef::Kubernetes[`kubectl` and]
`oc` command-line tools are installed and configured to connect to the running cluster.

ifdef::InstallationAppendix[]
When no existing {ProductPlatformName} cluster is available, `Minikube` or `Minishift` can be used to create a local
cluster. More details can be found in xref:installing_kubernetes_and_openshift_cluster[Installing Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters].
endif::InstallationAppendix[]

[NOTE]
To run the commands in this guide, your
ifdef::Kubernetes[{KubernetesLongName} and]
{OpenShiftLongName} user must have the rights to manage role-based access control (RBAC).

==== `KafkaTopic` resources

When the Topic Operator is deployed by the Cluster Operator it will be configured to watch for `KafkaTopics` with the label `strimzi.io/cluster: _<cluster-name>_`

NOTE: When the Topic Operator is deployed manually the `strimzi.io/cluster` label is not necessary.

The `KafkaTopic` contains the topic configuration in a specific format, described in xref:type-KafkaTopic-reference[].

=== Logging
The `logging` field allows the configuration of loggers. These loggers are listed below.
[source]
rootLogger.level

For information on the logging options and examples of how to set logging, see <<logging_examples, logging examples>> for Kafka.

When using external ConfigMap remember to place your custom ConfigMap under `log4j2.properties` key.
