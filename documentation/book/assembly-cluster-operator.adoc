= Cluster Operator

{ProductName} uses the Cluster Operator to deploy and manage Kafka (including Zookeeper) and Kafka Connect clusters.
The Cluster Operator is deployed inside of the
ifdef::Kubernetes[Kubernetes or]
OpenShift cluster.
To deploy a Kafka cluster, a `Kafka` resource with the cluster configuration has to be created within the
ifdef::Kubernetes[Kubernetes or]
OpenShift cluster.
Based on what is declared inside of the `Kafka` resource, the Cluster Operator deploys a corresponding Kafka cluster.
For more information about the different configuration options supported by the `Kafka` resource, see xref:assembly-deployment-configuration-kafka-str[]

NOTE: {ProductName} contains example YAML files, which make deploying a Cluster Operator easier.
