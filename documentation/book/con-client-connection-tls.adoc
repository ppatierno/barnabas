= Kafka Client connections through TLS

Encrypted communication between Kafka brokers and clients is provided through the `CLIENTTLS` listener on port 9093.

NOTE: You can use the `CLIENT` listener on port 9092 for unencrypted communication with brokers.

If a Kafka client wants to connect to the encrypted listener (`CLIENTTLS`) on port 9093, it needs to trust the cluster CA certificate in order to verify the broker certificate received during the SSL/TLS handshake.
The cluster CA certificate can be extracted from the generated `_cluster-name_-cluster-ca-cert` `Secret`.

ifdef::Kubernetes[]
On {KubernetesName}, extract the certificate using the following command:

[source,shell]
kubectl get secret <cluster-name>-cluster-ca-cert -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' | base64 -d > ca.crt

endif::Kubernetes[]

On {OpenShiftName}, extract the certificate using the following command:

[source,shell]
oc get secret <cluster-name>-cluster-ca-cert -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' | base64 -d > ca.crt

The Kafka client has to be configured to trust certificates signed by this CA.
For the Java-based Kafka Producer, Consumer and Streams APIs, you can do this by importing the CA certificate into the JVM's truststore using the following keytool command:

[source,shell]
keytool -keystore client.truststore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca.crt

Lastly, specify the following properties to configure the Kafka client:

* `security.protocol`: SSL is the value for using encryption.
* `ssl.truststore.location`: the truststore location where the certificates were imported.
* `ssl.truststore.password`: password for accessing the truststore. This property can be omitted if it is not needed by the truststore.
