= SCRAM-SHA authentication

Kafka can be configured to use SASL SCRAM-SHA to provide authentication on both unencrypted and TLS connections. 
When used with a TLS connection, the TLS protocol is providing encryption, but not authentication.

SCRAM (Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism) is an authentication protocol that can establish mutual authentication using passwords. SCRAM has some useful properties which mean it is considered safe to use SCRAM-SHA even on unencrypted connections:

* The passwords are not sent in the clear over the communication channel.
Instead the client and the server are each challenged by the other to offer proof that they know the password of the authenticating user.

* The server and client each generate a new challenge one each authentication exchange. 
This means that the exchange is resilient against replay attacks.

== When to use SCRAM-SHA authentication for clients

SCRAM-SHA is a suitable choice for authenticating Kafka clients when:

* The client supports authentication using SCRAM-SHA-512
* It is necessary or desirable to use passwords (rather than TLS certificates)
* It is necessary or desirable to have unencrypted communication, while still having authentication.
