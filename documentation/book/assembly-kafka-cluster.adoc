You can use {ProductName} to deploy ephemeral and persistent Kafka clusters.

Ephemeral:: An ephemeral Kafka cluster is only suitable for development and testing purposes, not for production. This deployment uses `emptyDir` volumes for storing broker information (Zookeeper) and topics or partitions (Kafka). Using an `emptyDir` volume means that its content is strictly related to the pod life cycle and is deleted when the pod goes down.

Persistent:: A persistent Kafka cluster uses `PersistentVolumes` to store Zookeeper and Kafka data. The `PersistentVolume` is
acquired using a `PersistentVolumeClaim` to make it independent of the actual type of the `PersistentVolume`. For example, it can use
ifdef::Kubernetes[HostPath volumes on Minikube or]
Amazon EBS volumes in Amazon AWS deployments without any changes in the YAML files. The `PersistentVolumeClaim` can use a `StorageClass` to trigger automatic volume provisioning.

When installing Kafka, {ProductName} also installs a Zookeeper cluster and adds the necessary configuration to connect Kafka with Zookeeper.
