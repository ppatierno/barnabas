= Producing messages to topics and partitions using the API

Intro

.Prerequisites

* The Kafka Bridge is deployed to your Kubernetes cluster.
* The Kafka Bridge Service is exposed to your local machine on port 8080.
* [environment variable for BRIDGE]

.Procedure

. In a text editor, create a YAML definition for a Kafka topic with three partitions. The topic is intended for use in this quick start guide only.
+
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]

apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
kind: KafkaTopic
metadata:

  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: <kafka-cluster-name> <1>

----
<1> The name of the Kafka cluster in which the Kafka Bridge is deployed.

. Save the file to the `examples/topic` directory as `bridge-quickstart-topic.yaml`.

. Create the topic in your Kubernetes cluster:
+
[source,shell,subs=attributes+]
----
oc apply -f examples/topic/bridge-quickstart-topic.yaml
----

. Using curl or a HTTP client application, produce three records to the topic you created:
+
[source,curl,subs=attributes+]
----
curl -X POST \
  http://$BRIDGE/topics/bridge-quickstart-topic \
  -H 'content-type: application/vnd.kafka.json.v2+json' \
  -d '{
    "records": [
        {
            "key": "my-key",<1>
            "value": "sales-lead-0001"
        },
        {
            "value": "sales-lead-0002",
            "partition": 2<2>
        },
        {
            "value": "sales-lead-0003"<3>
        }
    ]
}'
----
+
<1> Records containing a key are sent to a partition based on the hash of the key.
<2> Records containing a partition are sent to that partition. 
<3> Records containing a value only are sent to a partition using a round-robin method.

NOTE: /topics/partition endpoint alternative way to send msgs to partition. 

the second one has the specified destination partition and the value
