= Configuring a Jaeger tracer for Kafka clients

//In order to instrument an application using OpenTracing specification, a compatible OpenTracing tracer must be deployed. A list of the all the supported tracers is available here. From OpenTracing docs.

You can configure and create a Jaeger tracer by using environment variables.

.Prerequisites

* A running Kafka cluster.
*
*

.Procedure

Perform the following steps for every client application that you want to configure for distributed tracing.

. Add dependencies for Jaeger and OpenTracing to the Maven project for the client application. For example:
+
[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.jaegertracing</groupId>
    <artifactId>jaeger-client</artifactId>
    <version>$jaegerVersion</version>
</dependency>
----[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----

. Define the configuration of the Jaeger tracer by using xref:ref-tracing-environment-variables-{context}[environment variables].

. Create the Jaeger tracer from the environment variables that you defined in step two:
+
[source,java,subs=attributes+]
----
Tracer tracer = Configuration.fromEnv().getTracer();
----

. Register the Jaeger tracer as a global tracer.
