= Initializing a Jaeger tracer for Kafka clients

Before you can instrument client applications for distributed tracing, you must configure and initialize a Jaeger tracer instance.

.Prerequisites

* ???

.Procedure

Perform the following steps for every client application that you want to configure for distributed tracing.

. Add dependencies for Jaeger and OpenTracing to the Maven project for the client application. For example:
+
[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.jaegertracing</groupId>
    <artifactId>jaeger-client</artifactId>
    <version>$jaegerVersion</version>
</dependency>
----

. Define the configuration of the Jaeger tracer by using xref:ref-tracing-environment-variables-{context}[environment variables].

. Create the Jaeger tracer from the environment variables that you defined in step two:
+
[source,java,subs=attributes+]
----
Tracer tracer = Configuration.fromEnv().getTracer();
----
+
NOTE: For alternative ways to initialize a Jaeger tracer, see the https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-java/tree/master/jaeger-core[Java OpenTracing library^] documentation.

. Register the Jaeger tracer as a global tracer. For more information, see https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-java[OpenTracing API for Java^].
