= Kafka Mirror Maker loggers

Kafka Mirror Maker has its own configurable logger:

* `mirrormaker.root.logger`

Use the `logging` property to configure loggers and logger levels.

You can set the log levels by specifying the logger and level directly (inline) or use a custom (external) ConfigMap.

Here we see examples of `inline` and `external` logging:

[source,yaml,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: KafkaMirrorMaker
spec:
  # ...
  logging:
    type: inline
    loggers:
      mirrormaker.root.logger: "INFO"
  # ...
----

[source,yaml,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: KafkaMirrorMaker
spec:
  # ...
  logging:
    type: external
    name: customConfigMap
  # ...
