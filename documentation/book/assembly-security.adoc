{ProductName} supports encrypted communication between the Kafka and {ProductName} components using the TLS protocol.
Communication between Kafka brokers (interbroker communication), between Zookeeper nodes (internodal communication), and between these and the {ProductName} operators is always encrypted.
Communication between Kafka clients and Kafka brokers will be encrypted according how the cluster is configured.
For the Kafka and {ProductName} components, TLS certificates are also used for authentication.

The Cluster Operator sets up the TLS certificates to provide this encryption and authentication.
