[id='deploying-cluster-operator-{context}']
= Deploying the Cluster Operator

{ProductName} uses the Cluster Operator to deploy and manage Kafka (including Zookeeper) and Kafka Connect
clusters.
The Cluster Operator is deployed as a process running inside of the {ProductPlatformName} cluster.
To deploy a Kafka cluster, a `Kafka` resource with the cluster configuration has to be created within the {ProductPlatformName} cluster.
Based on the information in that `Kafka` resource,
the Cluster Operator deploys a corresponding Kafka cluster.
The format of the `Kafka` resource is described in xref:'kafka-resource-format{context}[Overview of Kafka Resource format].

NOTE: {ProductName} contains example YAML files which make deploying a Cluster Operator easier.
