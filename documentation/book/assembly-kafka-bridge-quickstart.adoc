[id='assembly-kafka-bridge-quickstart-{context}']
= Kafka Bridge quick start

Follow the procedures in this quick start to get started with the {ProductName} Kafka Bridge. The quick start describes how to deploy the Kafka Bridge to your OpenShift cluster and make it available to your local machine. You can then produce records to topics and perform common consumer operations by making HTTP requests to the API.

NOTE: To run and manage a Kubernetes cluster on your local machine, use a tool such as Minikube, CodeReady Containers, or MiniShift.

.Prerequisites for the quick start

* Cluster administrator access to a local or remote Kubernetes cluster. 
* {ProductName} is installed.
* A running Kafka cluster, deployed by the Cluster Operator, in a Kubernetes namespace.
* The Cluster Operator `RoleBindings` are installed.
* The Entity Operator is running and the Topic Operator and User Operator are both enabled.
