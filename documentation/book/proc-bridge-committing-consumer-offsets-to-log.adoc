= Commiting offsets to the log

Next, manually commit  offsets to the log for all messages received by a Kafka Bridge consumer by using the link:https://strimzi.io/docs/bridge/latest/#_commit[offsets^] endpoint. This is required because the Kafka Bridge consumer that you created earlier, in xref:proc-creating-kafka-bridge-consumer-{context}[Creating a Kafka Bridge consumer], was configured with the `enable.auto.commit` setting as `false`.

.Procedure

* Commit offsets to the log for the `bridge-quickstart-consumer`: 
+
[source,curl,subs=attributes+]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/consumers/bridge-quickstart-consumer-group/instances/bridge-quickstart-consumer/offsets \
  -H 'content-type: application/vnd.kafka.v2+json' \
  -d '{}'
----
+
Here the request body contains an empty object, so offsets are committed for all the records received by the consumer. Alternatively, you can use the link:https://strimzi.io/docs/bridge/latest/#_offsetcommitseeklist[OffsetCommitSeekList^] array to specify the topics and partitions for which you want to commit offsets.
+
If the request is successful, the Kafka Bridge returns a `204` code only.

.What to do next

After committing offsets to the log, try out the endpoints for xref:proc-bridge-seeking-offset-for-partition-{context}[seeking to offsets].
