= Overview of the Cluster Operator component

The Cluster Operator is in charge of deploying a Kafka cluster alongside a Zookeeper ensemble.
As part of the Kafka cluster, it can also deploy the topic operator which provides operator-style topic management via `KafkaTopic` custom resources.
The Cluster Operator is also able to deploy a Kafka Connect cluster which connects to an existing Kafka cluster.
On {OpenShiftName} such a cluster can be deployed using the Source2Image feature, providing an easy way of including more connectors.

When the Cluster Operator is up, it starts to _watch_ for certain {ProductPlatformName} resources containing the desired Kafka or Kafka Connect cluster configuration.
By default it watches only in the same namespace or project where it is installed.
Cluster operator can be configured to watch for more namespaces or projects.
The resources Cluster Operator is watching for are:

* A `Kafka` resource for Kafka cluster.
* A `KafkaConnect` resource for Kafka Connect cluster.
* A `KafkaConnectS2I` resource for Kafka Connect cluster with Source2Image support.

When a new desired resource (that is, a `Kafka`, `KafkaConnect`, or `KafkaConnectS2I` resource) is created in the {ProductPlatformName} cluster, the operator gets the cluster description from the desired resource and starts creating a new Kafka or Kafka Connect cluster by creating the necessary other {ProductPlatformName} resources, such as StatefulSets, Services, ConfigMaps, and so on.

Every time the desired resource is updated by the user, the operator performs corresponding updates on the {ProductPlatformName} resources which make up the Kafka or Kafka Connect cluster.
Resources are either patched or deleted and then re-created in order to make the Kafka or Kafka Connect cluster reflect the state of the desired cluster resource.
This might cause a rolling update which might lead to service disruption.

Finally, when the desired resource is deleted, the operator starts to undeploy the cluster and delete all the related {ProductPlatformName} resources.
