= What the Cluster Operator does

The Cluster Operator is in charge of deploying a Kafka cluster alongside a Zookeeper ensemble.
As part of the Kafka cluster, it can also deploy the topic operator which provides operator-style topic management via `KafkaTopic` custom resources.
The Cluster Operator is also able to deploy a Kafka Connect cluster which connects to an existing Kafka cluster.
On {OpenShiftName} such a cluster can be deployed using the Source2Image feature, providing an easy way of including more connectors.

When the Cluster Operator is up, it starts to _watch_ for certain {ProductPlatformName} resources containing the desired Kafka or Kafka Connect cluster configuration.
A `Kafka` resource is used for Kafka cluster configuration, and a `KafkaConnect` resource is used for Kafka Connect cluster configuration.

When a new desired resource (that is, a `Kafka` or `KafkaConnect` resource) is created in the {ProductPlatformName} cluster, the operator gets the cluster configuration from the desired resource and starts creating a new Kafka or Kafka Connect cluster by creating the necessary other {ProductPlatformName} resources, such as StatefulSets, Services, ConfigMaps, and so on.

Every time the desired resource is updated by the user, the operator performs corresponding updates on the {ProductPlatformName} resources which make up the Kafka or Kafka Connect cluster.
Resources are either patched or deleted and then re-created in order to make the Kafka or Kafka Connect cluster reflect the state of the desired cluster resource.
This might cause a rolling update which might lead to service disruption.

Finally, when the desired resource is deleted, the operator starts to undeploy the cluster and delete all the related {ProductPlatformName} resources.
