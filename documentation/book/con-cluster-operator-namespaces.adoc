= Watching multiple namespaces

The Cluster Operator is able to watch for `Kafka`, `KafkaConnect`, and `KafkaConnectS2I` resources in multiple namespaces without being installed on each namespace individually.

NOTE: The only reason to run multiple Cluster Operators in a single cluster is to use different versions of {ProductName}.

The `STRIMZI_NAMESPACE` environment variable can be used to configure a single operator instance to operate in multiple namespaces.
For each namespace given, the operator will watch for the `Kafka`, `KafkaConnect`, and `KafkaConnectS2I` and perform periodic reconciliation.
For more details about the `STIRMZI_NAMESPACE` environment variable, see xref:ref-operators-cluster-operator-configuration-{context}[].
