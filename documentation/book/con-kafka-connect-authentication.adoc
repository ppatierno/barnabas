= Authentication support in Kafka Connect

Authentication is configured through the `authentication` property in `KafkaConnect.spec` and `KafkaConnectS2I.spec`.
The `authentication` property specifies the type of the authentication mechanisms which should be used and additional configuration details depending on the mechanism.
The currently supported authentication types are:

* TLS client authentication
* SASL based authentication using the SCRAM-SHA-512 mechanism


== TLS Client Authentication

To use TLS client authentication, set the `type` property to the value `tls`.
TLS client authentication uses a TLS certificate to authenticate.
The certificate is specified in the `certificateAndKey` property and is always loaded from an {ProductPlatformName} secret.
In the secret, the certificate must be stored in X509 format under two different keys: public and private.

NOTE: TLS client authentication can be used only with TLS connections.
For more details about TLS configuration in Kafka Connect see xref:assembly-kafka-connect-tls-{context}[].

== SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication

To configure Kafka Connect to use SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication, set the `type` property to `scram-sha-512`.
This authentication mechanism requires a username and password.

* Specify the username in the `username` property.
* In the `passwordSecret` property, specify a link to a `Secret` containing the password. The `secretName` property contains the name of the `Secret` and the `password` property contains the name of the key under which the password is stored inside the `Secret`.

WARNING: Do not specify the actual password in the `password` field.
