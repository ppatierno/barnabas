= Mutual TLS authentication for clients

== Mutual TLS authentication

Kafka can be configured to use TLS (Transport Layer Security) to provide encrypted communication between Kafka brokers and clients either with or without _mutual authentication_.

Mutual authentication is when both parties to a communication get proof of the identity of the other party: The broker authenticates the client and the client authenticates the broker.

NOTE: In many common uses of TLS (such as the HTTPS protocol used between a web browser and a web server) the authentication is not mutual: Only one party to the communication gets proof of the identity of the other party.

== When to use mutual TLS authentication for clients

Mutual TLS authentication is a suitable choice for authenticating Kafka clients when:

* The client supports authentication using mutual TLS authentication
* It is necessary or desirable to use TLS certificates (rather than passwords)
* You are able to reconfigure and restart client applications periodically (so they do not use certificate which have expired).
