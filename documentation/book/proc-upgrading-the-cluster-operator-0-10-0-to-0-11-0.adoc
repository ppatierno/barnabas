= Upgrading the Cluster Operator from 0.10.0 to 0.11.0

This procedure will describe how to upgrade a Cluster Operator deployment from version 0.10.0 to version 0.11.0.
The availability of Kafka clusters managed by the Cluster Operator is not affected by the upgrade operation.

.Prerequisites 

* An existing version 0.10.0 Cluster Operator deployment to be upgraded.

.Procedure

. Backup the existing Cluster Operator resources.
+
ifdef::Kubernetes[]
On {KubernetesName} use `kubectl get`:
+
----
kubectl get all -l app=strimzi -o yaml > strimzi-backup.yaml
----
+
endif::Kubernetes[]
On {OpenShiftName} use `oc get`:
+
----
oc get all -l app=strimzi -o yaml > strimzi-backup.yaml
----

. Update the Cluster Operator. 
You will need to modify the installation files according to the namespace the Cluster Operator is running in.
+
include::frag-cluster-operator-namespace-sed.adoc[]
+
If you modified one or more environment variables in your existing Cluster Operator `Deployment`, edit
`install/cluster-operator/050-Deployment-cluster-operator.yaml` to reflect the changes that you made.

. When you have an updated configuration you can deploy it along with the rest of the install resources.
+
ifdef::Kubernetes[]
On {KubernetesName} use `kubectl apply`:
+
----
kubectl apply -f install/cluster-operator
----
+
endif::Kubernetes[]
On {OpenShiftName} use `oc apply`:
+
----
oc apply -f install/cluster-operator
----
+
Wait for the associated rolling updates to complete.

. Update existing resources to cope with deprecated custom resource properties.
+
* If you have `Kafka` resources that specify `Kafka.spec.topicOperator`, rewrite them to use `Kafka.spec.entityOperator.topicOperator` instead.
