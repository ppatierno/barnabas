= Authorization

Authorization can be configured using the `authorization` property in the `Kafka.spec.kafka` resource.
When the `authorization` property is missing, no authorization will be enabled.
When authorization is enabled it will be applied for all enabled xref:assembly-configuring-kafka-broker-listeners-{context}[listeners].
The authorization method is defined by the `type` field.

Currently, the only supported authorization method is the Simple authorization.

== Simple authorization

Simple authorization is using the `SimpleAclAuthorizer` plugin.
`SimpleAclAuthorizer` is the default authorization plugin which is part of Apache Kafka.
To enable simple authorization, the `type` field should be set to `simple`.
