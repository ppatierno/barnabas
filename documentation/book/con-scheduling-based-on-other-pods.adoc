= Avoid critical applications to share the node

When two applications are scheduled to the same {ProductPlatformName} node they can affect each other.
This happens especially when both of these workloads are heavily using the same resources such as for example disk I/O.
Pod anti-affinity can be used to make sure that some critical applications are never scheduled on the same disk.
When running Kafka cluster, this should be typically used to ensure that the Kafka brokers do not share the nodes with other workloads such as databases.
