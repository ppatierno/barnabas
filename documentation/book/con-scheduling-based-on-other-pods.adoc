= Avoid critical applications to share the node

When two application are scheduled to the same {ProductPlatformName} node, both applications might use the same resources like disk I/O and impact performance.
You can use pod anti-affinity to ensure that critical applications are never scheduled on the same disk.
When running Kafka cluster, it is recommended to use pod anti-affinity to ensure that the Kafka brokers do not share the nodes with other workloads like databases.

When two applications are scheduled to the same {ProductPlatformName} node they can affect each other.
This happens especially when both of these workloads are heavily using the same resources such as for example disk I/O.
Pod anti-affinity can be used to make sure that some critical applications are never scheduled on the same disk.
When running Kafka cluster, this should be typically used to ensure that the Kafka brokers do not share the nodes with other workloads such as databases.
