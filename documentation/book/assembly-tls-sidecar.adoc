= TLS Sidecar

Sidecar is a container which is running in a pod and serves an auxiliary purpose.
In case of TLS sidecar, the purpose is encrypting / decrypting the communication between {ProductName} componenets and Zookeeper.
Zookeeper doesn't support TLS encryption natively.
Therefore {ProductName} uses the sidecar to add the TLS support.

The TLS sidecar is currrently being used in:

* Kafka brokers
* Zookeeper
* Entity Operator
