= Authentication

Authentication is configured as part of the xref:assembly-configuring-kafka-broker-listeners-{context}[listener configuration] in the `authentication` property.
When the `authentication` property is missing, no authentication will be enabled on given listener.
The authentication mechanism which will be used is defined by the `type` field.

The supported authentication mechanisms are: 

* TLS client authentication
* SASL SCRAM-SHA-512

== TLS client authentication

TLS Client authentication can be enabled by specifying the `type` as `tls`.
The TLS client authentication is supported only on the `tls` listener.
