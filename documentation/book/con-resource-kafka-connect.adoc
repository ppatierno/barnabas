[id='kafka-connect-resource-{context}']
= Kafka Connect

The operator watches for `KafkaConnect` resource in order to find and get configuration for a Kafka Connect cluster to deploy.

The `KafkaConnectS2I` resource provides configuration for a Kafka Connect cluster deployment using Build and Source2Image features and works only with {OpenShiftName}.

Labels that are applied to the `KafkaConnect` or `KafkaConnectS2I` resources will also be applied to the {ProductPlatformName} resources making up the Kafka Connect cluster. This provides a convenient mechanism for those resource to be labelled in the users preferred way.

The `KafkaConnect` resource supports the following within its `spec`:

.KafkaConnect Parameters
[cols="30%,50%,20%",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter
|Description
|Default Value

|`nodes`
|Number of Kafka Connect worker nodes.
|1

|`image`
| The Docker image to be used by the Kafka Connect workers. The default value is determined by the value specified in the  xref:STRIMZI_DEFAULT_KAFKA_CONNECT_IMAGE[`STRIMZI_DEFAULT_KAFKA_CONNECT_IMAGE`] environment variable of the Cluster Operator. If S2I is used on {OpenShiftName}, then it should be the related S2I image.
|

|`healthcheck-delay`
|The initial delay for the liveness and readiness probes for each Kafka Connect worker node.
|60

|`healthcheck-timeout`
|The timeout on the liveness and readiness probes for each Kafka Connect worker node.
|5

|`connect-config`
| A JSON string with Kafka Connect configuration. For more information, see xref:kafka_connect_configuration_json_config-{context}[Kafka Connect configuration].
|

|`metrics-config`
|A JSON string representing the JMX exporter configuration for exposing metrics from Kafka Connect nodes. When this field is absent no metrics will be exposed.
|

|`resources`
| A JSON string configuring the resource limits and requests for Kafka Connect containers. For information about the accepted JSON format, see xref:resources_json_config[Resource limits and requests].
|

|`jvmOptions`
|A JSON string allowing the JVM running Kafka Connect to be configured. For information about the accepted JSON format, xref:jvm-json-config-{context}[JVM Options].
|

|`affinity`
| Node and Pod affinity for the Kafka Connect pods, as described in xref:affinity[Node and Pod Affinity]. The format of the corresponding key is the same as the content supported in the Pod `affinity` in {ProductPlatformName}.
