= Zookeeper communication

By deploying a `stunnel` sidecar within every Zookeeper pod, the Cluster Operator is able to provide data encryption and authentication between Zookeeper nodes in a cluster.
The `stunnel` sidecar proxies all Zookeeper traffic, TLS decrypts data upon entry into a Zookeeper pod, and then TLS encrypts data upon departure from a Zookeeper pod.
This TLS encrypting `stunnel` proxy is instantiated from the `spec.zookeeper.stunnelImage` specified in the Kafka resource.
