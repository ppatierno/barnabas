= Exposing Kafka using OpenShift `Routes`

An external listener of type `route` exposes Kafka by using OpenShift `Routes` and the HAProxy router.
A dedicated `Route` is created for every Kafka broker pod.
An additional `Route` is created to serve as a Kafka bootstrap address.
Kafka clients can use these `Routes` to connect to Kafka on port 443.

When exposing Kafka using OpenShift `Routes`, TLS encryption is always used.

By default, the route hosts are automatically assigned by OpenShift.
However, you can override the assigned route hosts by specifying the requested hosts in the `overrides` property.
{ProductName} will not perform any validation that the requested hosts are available; you must ensure that they are free and can be used.

= Exposing Kafka using loadbalancers

External listeners of type `loadbalancer` expose Kafka by using `Loadbalancer` type `Services`.
A new loadbalancer service is created for every Kafka broker pod.
An additional loadbalancer is created to serve as a Kafka _bootstrap_ address.
Loadbalancers listen to connections on port 9094.

By default, TLS encryption is enabled.
To disable it, set the `tls` field to `false`.

= Exposing Kafka using node ports

External listeners of type `nodeport` expose Kafka by using `NodePort` type `Services`.
When exposing Kafka in this way, Kafka clients connect directly to the nodes of Kubernetes.
You must enable access to the ports on the Kubernetes nodes for each client (for example, in firewalls or security groups).
Each Kafka broker pod is then accessible on a separate port.
Additional `NodePort` type `Service` is created to serve as a Kafka bootstrap address.

When configuring the advertised addresses for the Kafka broker pods, {ProductName} uses the address of the node on which the given pod is running.
When selecting the node address, the different address types are used with the following priority:

. ExternalDNS
. ExternalIP
. Hostname
. InternalDNS
. InternalIP

By default, TLS encryption is enabled.
To disable it, set the `tls` field to `false`.

NOTE: TLS hostname verification is not currently supported when exposing Kafka clusters using node ports.

By default, the port numbers used for the bootstrap and broker services are automatically assigned by Kubernetes.
However, you can override the assigned node ports by specifying the requested port numbers in the `overrides` property.
{ProductName} does not perform any validation on the requested ports; you must ensure that they are free and available for use.

        nodePort: 32001
      - broker: 2
        nodePort: 32002
# ...

= Exposing Kafka using Kubernetes `Ingress`

An external listener of type `ingress` exposes Kafka by using Kubernetes `Ingress` and the {NginxIngressController}.
A dedicated `Ingress` resource is created for every Kafka broker pod.
An additional `Ingress` resource is created to serve as a Kafka bootstrap address.
Kafka clients can use these `Ingress` resources to connect to Kafka on port 443.

NOTE: External listeners using `Ingress` have been currently tested only with the {NginxIngressController}.

{ProductName} uses the TLS passthrough feature of the {NginxIngressController}.
Make sure TLS passthrough is enabled in your {NginxIngressController} deployment.
For more information about enabling TLS passthrough see {NginxIngressControllerTLSPassthrough}.
Because it is using the TLS passthrough functionality, TLS encryption cannot be disabled when exposing Kafka using `Ingress`.

The Ingress controller does not assign any hostnames automatically.
You have to specify the hostnames which should be used by the bootstrap and per-broker services in the `spec.kafka.listeners.external.configuration` section.
You also have to make sure that the hostnames resolve to the Ingress endpoints.
{ProductName} will not perform any validation that the requested hosts are available and properly routed to the Ingress endpoints.

= Customizing advertised addresses on external listeners

By default, {ProductName} tries to automatically determine the hostnames and ports that your Kafka cluster advertises to its clients.
This is not sufficient in all situations, because the infrastructure on which {ProductName} is running might not provide the right hostname or port through which Kafka can be accessed.
You can customize the advertised hostname and port in the `overrides` property of the external listener.
{ProductName} will then automatically configure the advertised address in the Kafka brokers and add it to the broker certificates so it can be used for TLS hostname verification.
Overriding the advertised host and ports is available for all types of external listeners.

listeners:
  external:
    type: route

        advertisedHost: example.hostname.0
        advertisedPort: 12340
      - broker: 1
        advertisedHost: example.hostname.1
        advertisedPort: 12341
      - broker: 2
        advertisedHost: example.hostname.2
        advertisedPort: 12342
# ...
----

Additionally, you can specify the name of the bootstrap service.
This name will be added to the broker certificates and can be used for TLS hostname verification.
Adding the additional bootstrap address is available for all types of external listeners.

= Customizing DNS names of external listeners

On `loadbalancer` and `ingress` listeners, you can use the `dnsAnnotations` property to add additional annotations to the ingress resources or load balancer services.
You can use these annotations to instrument DNS tooling such as {KubernetesExternalDNS}, which automatically assigns DNS names to the ingress resources or services.
