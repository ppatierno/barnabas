= Entity Operator

The Entity Operator is responsible for managing different entities in a running Kafka cluster.
The currently supported entities are:

Kafka topics:: managed by the Topic Operator.
Kafka users:: managed by the User Operator

Both Topic and User Operators can be deployed on their own.
But the easiest way to deploy them is together with the Kafka cluster as part of the Entity Operator.
The Entity Operator can include either one or both of them depending on the configuration.
They will be automatically configured to manage the topics and users of the Kafka cluster with which they are deployed.

For more information about how to use Topic Operator to create or delete topics, see xref:using-the-topic-operator-str[].
