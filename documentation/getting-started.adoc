== Getting started

=== Prerequisites

A Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster is required to deploy Strimzi. Strimzi supports all kinds of clusters - from public and
private clouds down to local deployments intended for development purposes. This guide expects that a Kubernetes or
OpenShift cluster is available and the `kubectl` or `oc` command line tools are installed and configured to connect
to the running cluster.

When no existing Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster is available, `Minikube` or `Minishift` can be used to create a local
cluster. More details can be found in <<_installing_kubernetes_and_openshift_cluster>>


=== Cluster Controller

Strimzi uses a component called the Cluster Controller to deploy and manage Kafka (including Zookeeper) and Kafka Connect
clusters. The Cluster Controller is deployed as a process running inside your Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster. To deploy a
Kafka cluster, a ConfigMap with the cluster configuration has to be created. Based on the information in that ConfigMap,
the Cluster Controller will deploy a corresponding Kafka cluster. By default, the ConfigMap needs to be labeled with
following labels:

[source,yaml]
strimzi.io/type: kafka
strimzi.io/kind: cluster

and contain the cluster configuration in a specific format. The ConfigMap format is described in <<config_map_details>>.

The Strimzi project contains example YAML files which make deploying a Cluster Controller easier.

==== Deploying to Kubernetes

To deploy the Cluster Controller on Kubernetes, the following command should be executed:

[source]
kubectl create -f resources/kubernetes/cluster-controller.yaml

To verify whether the Cluster Controller has been deployed successfully, the Kubernetes Dashboard or the following
command can be used:

[soruce]
kubectl describe all

==== Deploying to OpenShift

To deploy the Cluster Controller on OpenShift, the following command should be executed:

[source]
oc create -f resources/openshift/cluster-controller-with-template.yaml

To verify whether the Cluster Controller has been deployed successfully, the OpenShift console or the following command
can be used:

[soruce]
oc describe all

=== Kafka broker

Strimzi uses StatefulSets feature of Kubernetes/OpenShift to deploy Kafka brokers.
With StatefulSets, the pods receive a unique name and network identity and that makes it easier to identify the
individual Kafka broker pods and set their identity (broker ID). The deployment uses **regular** and **headless**
services:

- regular services can be used as bootstrap servers for Kafka clients
- headless services are needed to have DNS resolve the pods IP addresses directly

As well as Kafka, Strimzi also installs a Zookeeper cluster and configures the Kafka brokers to connect to it. The
Zookeeper cluster also uses StatefulSets.

Strimzi provides two flavors of Kafka broker deployment: **ephemeral** and **persistent**.

The **ephemeral** flavour is suitable only for development and testing purposes and not for production. The
ephemeral flavour uses `emptyDir` volumes for storing broker information (Zookeeper) and topics/partitions
(Kafka). Using `emptyDir` volume means that its content is strictly related to the pod life cycle (it is
deleted when the pod goes down). This makes the in-memory deployment well-suited to development and testing because
you don't have to provide persistent volumes.

The **persistent** flavour uses PersistentVolumes to store Zookeeper and Kafka data. The PersistentVolume is
acquired using a PersistentVolumeClaim – that makes it independent of the actual type of the PersistentVolume. For
example, it can use HostPath volumes on Minikube or Amazon EBS volumes in Amazon AWS deployments without any
changes in the YAML files. The PersistentVolumeClaim can use a StorageClass to trigger automatic volume provisioning.

To deploy a Kafka cluster, a ConfigMap with the cluster configuration has to be created. By default, the ConfigMap
should have the following labels:

[source,yaml]
strimzi.io/type: kafka
strimzi.io/kind: cluster

Example ConfigMaps and the details about the ConfigMap format are in <<kafka_config_map_details>>.

==== Deploying to Kubernetes

To deploy a Kafka broker on Kubernetes, the corresponding ConfigMap has to be created. To create the ephemeral
cluster using the provided example ConfigMap, the following command should be executed:

[source]
kubectl apply -f resources/kubernetes/kafka-ephemeral.yaml

Another example ConfigMap is provided for persistent Kafka cluster. To deploy it, the following command should be run:

[source]
kubectl apply -f resources/kubernetes/kafka-persistent.yaml

==== Deploying to OpenShift

For OpenShift, the Kafka broker is provided in the form of a template. The cluster can be deployed from the template either
using the command line or using the OpenShift console. To create the ephemeral cluster, the following command should be
executed:

[source]
oc new-app strimzi-ephemeral

Similarly, to deploy a persistent Kafka cluster the following command should be run:

[source]
oc new-app strimzi-persistent

=== Kafka Connect

The Cluster Controller can also deploy a https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect[Kafka Connect] cluster which
can be used with either of the Kafka broker deployments described above. It is implemented as a Deployment with a
configurable number of workers. The default image currently contains only the Connectors distributed with Apache Kafka
Connect: `FileStreamSinkConnector` and `FileStreamSourceConnector`. The REST interface for managing the Kafka Connect
cluster is exposed internally within the Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster as `kafka-connect` service on port `8083`.

Example ConfigMaps and the details about the ConfigMap format for deploying Kafka Connect can be found in
<<kafka_connect_config_map_details>>.

==== Deploying to Kubernetes

To deploy Kafka Connect on Kubernetes, the corresponding ConfigMap has to be created. An example ConfigMap can be
created using the following command:

[source]
kubectl apply -f resources/kubernetes/kafka-connect.yaml

==== Deploying to OpenShift

On OpenShift, Kafka Connect is provided in the form of a template. It can be deployed from the template either
using the command line or using the OpenShift console. To create a Kafka Connect cluster from the command line, the following
command should be run:

[source]
oc new-app strimzi-connect

==== Using Kafka Connect with additional plugins

Strimzi Docker images for Kafka Connect contain, by default, only the `FileStreamSinkConnector` and
`FileStreamSourceConnector` connectors which are part of the Apache Kafka project.

To facilitate deployment with 3rd party connectors, Kafka Connect is configured to automatically load all
plugins/connectors which are present in the `/opt/kafka/plugins` directory during startup. There are two ways of adding
custom plugins into this directory:

- Using a custom Docker image
- Using the OpenShift build system with the Strimzi S2I image

===== Create a new image based on `strimzi/kafka-connect`

Strimzi provides its own Docker image for running Kafka Connect which can be found on Docker Hub as
https://hub.docker.com/r/strimzi/kafka-connect/[`strimzi/kafka-connect`]. This image could be used as a base image for
building a new custom image with additional plugins. The following steps describe the process for creating such a custom image:

1. Create a new `Dockerfile` which uses `strimzi/kafka-connect` as the base image

[source,Dockerfile]
FROM strimzi/kafka-connect:latest
USER root:root
COPY ./my-plugin/ /opt/kafka/plugins/
USER kafka:kafka

2. Build the Docker image and upload it to the appropriate Docker repository
3. Use the new Docker image in the Kafka Connect deployment:
  - On OpenShift, the template parameters `IMAGE_REPO_NAME`, `IMAGE_NAME` and `IMAGE_TAG` can be changed to point to the
  new image when the Kafka Connect cluster is being deployed
  - On Kubernetes, the Kafka Connect ConfigMap has to be modified to use the new image

===== Using OpenShift Build and S2I image

OpenShift supports https://docs.openshift.org/3.6/dev_guide/builds/index.html[Builds] which can be used together with
https://docs.openshift.org/3.6/creating_images/s2i.html#creating-images-s2i[Source-to-Image (S2I)] framework to create
new Docker images. OpenShift Build takes a builder image with S2I support together with source code and/or binaries
provided by the user and uses them to build a new Docker image. The newly created Docker Image will be stored in
OpenShift's local Docker repository and can then be used in deployments. The Strimzi project provides a Kafka Connect builder
image https://hub.docker.com/r/strimzi/kafka-connect-s2i/[`strimzi/kafka-connect-s2i`] with such S2I support. It takes user-provided
binaries (with plugins and connectors) and creates a new Kafka Connect image. This enhanced Kafka Connect image can be
used with our Kafka Connect deployment.

The S2I deployment is again provided as an OpenShift template. It can be deployed from the template either using the command
line or using the OpenShift console. To create Kafka Connect S2I cluster from the command line, the following command should
be run:

[source]
oc new-app strimzi-connect-s2i

Once the cluster is deployed, a new Build can be triggered from the command line:

1. A directory with Kafka Connect plugins has to be prepared first. For example:
+
[source,shell]

2. To start a new image build using the prepared directory, the following command has to be run:
+
[source]
oc start-build my-connect-cluster-connect --from-dir ./my-plugins/
+
_The name of the build should be changed according to the cluster name of the deployed Kafka Connect cluster._

3. Once the build is finished, the new image will be used automatically by the Kafka Connect deployment.
