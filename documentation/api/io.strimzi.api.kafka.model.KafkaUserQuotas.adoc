Kafka cluster allows user to enforce certain requests to control usage of the resources by clients.
We can divide quotas to the two groups:

* network usage quotas, which as are defined as the byte rate threshold for each group of clients sharing a quota
* hardware utilization quotas, which are defined as the percentage of time a client can utilize on request handler I/O threads and network threads of each broker within a quota window

There are several reasons why using quotas for the Kafka clients might be reasonable.
Let's consider wrongly set Kafka producer which is sending requests at high rate.
This can be considered as DoS attack and the client might get blocked.
With network limiting quota it is less probable to happen.
