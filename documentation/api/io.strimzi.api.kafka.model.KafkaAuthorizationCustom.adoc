To use custom authorization in Strimzi, you can configure your own `Authorizer` plugin to define Access Control Lists (ACLs).

ACLs allow you to define which users have access to which resources at a granular level.

Configure the `Kafka` custom resource to use custom authorization.
Set the `type` property in the `authorization` section to the value `custom`,
and the set following properties.

IMPORTANT: The custom Authorizer must implement the org.apache.kafka.server.authorizer.Authorizer interface, and support configuration of super users using the super.users configuration property.


=== `authorizerClass`
(Required)Java class that implements the `org.apache.kafka.server.authorizer.Authorizer` interface to support the custom ACLs.


[id='property-simple-authorization-superusers-{context}']
=== `superUsers`
A list of user principals treated as super users, so that they are always allowed without querying ACL rules.
For more information see xref:con-securing-kafka-authorization-str[Kafka authorization].

Configuration required for the custom authorizer can be provided using `Kafka.spec.kafka.config` and those properties will be supplied to custom authorizer in `config` method for initialization.

.An example of custom authorization configuration under `Kafka.spec`
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
spec:
  kafka:
    # ...
    authorization:
      type: custom
      authorizerClass: io.mycompany.CustomAuthorizer
      superUsers:
        - CN=client_1
        - user_2
        - CN=client_3
    # ...
    config:
      authorization.custom.property1=value1
      authorization.custom.property2=value2
    # ...
----

NOTE: The `super.user` configuration option in the `config` property in `Kafka.spec.kafka` is ignored.
Designate super users in the `authorization` property instead.
