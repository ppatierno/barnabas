Use `KafkaConnectSpec` properties to configure a Kafka Connect cluster.

.`logging`
Kafka Connect has its own configurable loggers:

* `log4j.rootLogger`
* `log4j.logger.org.reflections`

Further loggers are added depending on the Kafka Connect plugins running.

Use a curl request to get a complete list of Kafka Connect loggers running from any Kafka broker pod:

[source,curl,subs=attributes+]
----
curl -s http://<connect-cluster-name>-connect-api:8083/admin/loggers/
----

Kafka Connect uses the Apache `log4j` logger implementation.

Use the `logging` property to configure loggers and logger levels.

You can set the log levels by specifying the logger and level directly (inline) or use a custom (external) ConfigMap.
If a ConfigMap is used, you set `logging.name` property to the name of the ConfigMap containing the external logging configuration. Inside the ConfigMap, the logging configuration is described using `log4j.properties`.
For more information about log levels, see {ApacheLoggers}.

Here we see examples of `inline` and `external` logging.

.Inline logging
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: KafkaConnect
spec:
  # ...
  logging:
    type: inline
    loggers:
      log4j.rootLogger: "INFO"
  # ...
----

.External logging
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: KafkaConnect
spec:
  # ...
  logging:
    type: external
    name: customConfigMap
  # ...
----

Any available loggers that are not configured have their level set to `OFF`.

Changes to Kafka Connect logging levels are applied dynamically.

If you use external logging, a rolling update is triggered when logging appenders are changed.

.Garbage collector (GC)

Garbage collector logging can also be enabled (or disabled) using the xref:con-common-configuration-garbage-collection-reference[`jvmOptions` property].
