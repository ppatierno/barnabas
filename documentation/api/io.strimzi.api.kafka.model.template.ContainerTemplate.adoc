You can set custom security context and environment variables for a container.

The environment variables are defined under the `env` property as a list of objects with `name` and `value` fields.
The following example shows two custom environment variables set for the Kafka broker containers:

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
# ...
kind: Kafka
spec:
    kafka:
        template:
            kafkaContainer:
                env:
                    - name: TEST_ENV_1
                      value: test.env.one
                    - name: TEST_ENV_2
                      value: test.env.two
# ...
----

Environment variables prefixed with `KAFKA_` are internal to Strimzi and should be avoided.
If you set a custom environment variable that is already in use by Strimzi, it is ignored and a warning is recorded in the log.
