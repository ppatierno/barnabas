= OAuth 2.0 authentication mechanisms

You can configure OAuth 2.0 authentication using one of the following authentication mechanisms:

* SASL_OAUTHBEARER
* SASL_PLAIN

Both mechanisms establish an authenticated session with a Kafka broker. 
However, the authentication flow between the Kafka client, the authorization server, and the Kafka broker is different in each mechanism.

.SASL_OAUTHBEARER

Support for the SASL_OAUTHBEARER mechanism is built-in to many Kafka clients 

The Kafka _SASL OAUTHBEARER_ mechanism is used to establish authenticated sessions with a Kafka broker.

A Kafka client initiates a session with the Kafka broker using the _SASL OAUTHBEARER_ mechanism for credentials exchange, where credentials take the form of an access token.

Kafka brokers and clients need to be configured to use OAuth 2.0.

.SASL_PLAIN

An advantage of SASL_PLAIN is that it is supported by all Kafka client tools, including developer tools such as kafkacat.
