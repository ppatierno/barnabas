= Jmxtrans

JmxTrans reads JMX metrics data from secure or insecure Kafka brokers and pushes the data to remote sinks in various data formats.
An example use case of the Jmxtrans would be to obtain JMX metrics about the request rate of each Kafka broker's network
and push it to a Logstash database outside of the Kubernetes cluster.
