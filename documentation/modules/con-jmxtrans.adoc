= About JmxTrans

JmxTrans reads JMX metrics data from secure or insecure Kafka brokers and pushes the data to remote sinks in various data formats.
As an example use case, JmxTrans can obtain JMX metrics about the request rate of each Kafka broker's network and then push the data to a Logstash database outside the Kubernetes cluster.
