= Authentication support in Kafka Connect

You can configure authentication for Kafka Connect in the `authentication` property in `KafkaConnect.spec` and `KafkaConnectS2I.spec`. 
The `authentication` property specifies which of the supported authentication mechanisms to use, and additional configuration depending on the mechanism.

The following types of authentication are supported for Kafka Connect:

* TLS client authentication
* SASL-based authentication using the SCRAM-SHA-512 mechanism
* SASL-based authentication using the PLAIN mechanism
* xref:assembly-oauth-authentication_str[OAuth 2.0 token based authentication]

The following sections explain how each authentication mechanism works. 

== TLS Client authentication

To use TLS client authentication, set the `spec.authentication.type` property to `tls`.
TLS client authentication uses a TLS certificate to authenticate.
The certificate is specified in the `certificateAndKey` property and is always loaded from a Kubernetes Secret.

.Example showing TLS client authentication for Kafka Connect
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: KafkaConnect
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  # ...
  authentication:
    type: tls
    certificateAndKey:
      secretName: my-secret
      certificate: public.crt
      key: private.key
  # ...
----

In the Kubernetes Secret:

* The certificate must be stored in X509 format under the field named by the `certificate`
* The private key must be stored under the field named by the `key` property, as shown in the preceding example

To use this method, see xref:proc-configuring-kafka-connect-authentication-tls-{context}[].

NOTE: TLS client authentication can be used only with TLS connections.
For more details about TLS configuration in Kafka Connect see xref:assembly-kafka-connect-tls-{context}[].

== SASL-based SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication

To configure Kafka Connect to use SASL-based SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication, set the `spec.authentication.type` property to `scram-sha-512`.
This authentication mechanism requires a client username and password.

The password is contained in a Secret. 
The name of the Secret is supplied as the value of the `secretName` property, and the field within the Secret is supplied as the `password` property.

The `KafkaConnect` or `KafkaConnectS2I` custom resource references the Secret and its fields under the `passwordSecret` property. 

.Example showing SCRAM-SHA-512 client authentication for Kafka Connect
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: KafkaConnect
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  # ...
  authentication:
    type: scram-sha-512
    username: my-connect-username <1>
    passwordSecret:
      secretName: my-connect-secret-name <2>
      password: my-connect-password-field <3>
  # ...
----

<1> `username`: The username.
<2> `secretName`: The name of the Secret that contains the username and password.
<3> `password`: The name of the field in the Secret under which the password is stored. Do NOT specify the actual password.

kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-connect-secret-name
type: Opaque
data:
  my-connect-password-field: LFTIyFRFlMmU2N2Tm
----

To use this method, see xref:proc-configuring-kafka-connect-authentication-scram-sha-512-{context}[].

== SASL-based PLAIN authentication

To configure Kafka Connect to use SASL-based PLAIN authentication, set the `type` property to `plain`.
This authentication mechanism requires a username and password.

WARNING: The SASL PLAIN mechanism transfers the username and password across the network in cleartext.
Only use SASL PLAIN authentication if TLS encryption is enabled.

* Specify the username in the `username` property.
* In the `passwordSecret` property, specify a link to a `Secret` containing the password. The `secretName` property contains the name of such a `Secret` and the `password` property contains the name of the field under which the password is stored inside the `Secret`.

[WARNING]
====
Do NOT specify the actual password in the `passwordSecret.password` property.
