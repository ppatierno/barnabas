= JMX Options

Use the `jmxOptions` property to expose the JMX port on kafka brokers via the kafka broker headless service. You can
access the Kafka broker JMX by deploying a pod into the cluster and then referencing the specific broker you want
on the kafka broker headless service on port 9404.

JMX options allow you to gather JMX metrics from the Kafka brokers and also invoke MBean operations on the kafka broker.
This can be used to gather JMX metrics and export to remote sinks such as logstash and Splunk.

For more information on the supported options, see xref:ref-jmx-options-deployment-configuration-kafka[JMX configuration].
