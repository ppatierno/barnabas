= Configuring a Kafka user

Use the properties of the `KafkaUser` resource to configure a Kafka user.

You can use `kubectl apply` to create or modify users, and `kubectl delete` to delete existing users.

For example:

* `kubectl apply -f _<user-config-file>_`
* `kubectl delete KafkaUser _<user-name>_`

When you configure the `KafkaUser` authentication and authorization mechanisms, ensure they match the equivalent `Kafka` configuration:

* `KafkaUser.spec.authentication` matches `Kafka.spec.kafka.listeners.*.authentication`
* `KafkaUser.spec.authorization` matches `Kafka.spec.kafka.authorization`

This procedure shows how a user is created with TLS authentication.
You can also create a user with SCRAM-SHA authentication.

The authentication required depends on the xref:assembly-kafka-broker-listener-authentication-deployment-configuration-kafka[type of authentication configured for the Kafka broker listener].

NOTE: Authentication between Kafka users and Kafka brokers depends on the authentication settings for each.
For example, it is not possible to authenticate a user with TLS if it is not also enabled in the Kafka configuration.

.Prerequisites

* A running Kafka cluster xref:con-mutual-tls-authentication-deployment-configuration-kafka[configured with a Kafka broker listener using TLS authentication and encryption].
* A running User Operator (typically xref:assembly-kafka-entity-operator-deployment-configuration-kafka[deployed with the Entity Operator]).

If you are using SCRAM-SHA authentication, you need a running Kafka cluster xref:con-scram-sha-authentication-deployment-configuration-kafka[configured with a Kafka broker listener using SCRAM-SHA authentication].

.Procedure

. Prepare a YAML file containing the `KafkaUser` to be created.
+
.An example `KafkaUser`
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaUserApiVersion}
kind: KafkaUser
metadata:
  name: my-user
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:
  authentication: <1>
    type: tls
  authorization:
    type: simple <2>
    acls:
      - resource:
          type: topic
          name: my-topic
          patternType: literal
        operation: Read
      - resource:
          type: topic
          name: my-topic
          patternType: literal
        operation: Describe
      - resource:
          type: group
          name: my-group
          patternType: literal
        operation: Read
----
<1> User authentication mechanism, defined as mutual `tls` or `scram-sha-512`.
<2> Simple authorization, which requires an accompanying list of ACL rules.

. Create the `KafkaUser` resource in Kubernetes.
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
kubectl apply -f _USER-CONFIG-FILE_

. Use the credentials from the `my-user` secret in your client application.
