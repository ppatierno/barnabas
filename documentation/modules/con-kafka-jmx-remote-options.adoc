.Prerequisites

Use the `jmxRemote` property in the Kafka cluster spec to expose the JMX port on Kafka brokers via the Kafka broker headless service.
You can enable security on the broker by turning on security in the `jmxRemote` spec.

You can gather JMX metrics from the Kafka brokers by using the JMX options. For examples of JMX metrics that can be obtained,
see link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#remote_jmx[JMX metrics available on Kafka Brokers].
