= Whitelist

Use the `whitelist` property to configure a list of topics that Kafka MirrorMaker mirrors from the source to the target Kafka cluster.

The property allows any regular expression from the simplest case with a single topic name to complex patterns.
For example, you can mirror topics A and B using "A|B" or all topics using "*".
You can also pass multiple regular expressions separated by commas to the Kafka MirrorMaker.
