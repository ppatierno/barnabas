= Replicas

Use the `replicas` property to configure replicas.

You can run multiple MirrorMaker replicas to provide better availability and scalability.
When running Kafka MirrorMaker on Kubernetes it is not absolutely necessary to run multiple replicas of the Kafka MirrorMaker for high availability.
When the node where the Kafka MirrorMaker has deployed crashes, Kubernetes will automatically reschedule the Kafka MirrorMaker pod to a different node.
However, running Kafka MirrorMaker with multiple replicas can provide faster failover times as the other nodes will be up and running.
