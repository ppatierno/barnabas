= JMX configuration

JMX options can be configured using the `jmxOptions` property in following resources:

* `Kafka.spec.kafka`

.Example configuring jmx options
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
# ...
jmxOptions:
  enabled: true
# ...
----

In the above example, the JMX port on the Kafka brokers are opened and then the metrics port on the kafka headless service
is opened. This will allow you to deploy a pod internally into a cluster and address the JMX port on the kafka broker
by performing `<name of kafka broker>-<name of headless service>`


If nothing is specified, then it won't open up any ports on the kafka broker or the headless service.
