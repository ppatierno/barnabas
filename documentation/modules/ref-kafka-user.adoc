= Kafka user resource

The `KafkaUser` resource is used to configure the authentication mechanism, authorization mechanism, and access rights for a user.

The full schema for `KafkaUser` is described in xref:type-KafkaUser-reference[`KafkaUser` schema reference].

== User authentication

Authentication is configured using the `authentication` property in `KafkaUser.spec`.
The authentication mechanism enabled for the user is specified using the `type` field.

Supported authentication mechanisms:

* TLS client authentication
* SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication

When no authentication mechanism is specified, the User Operator does not create the user or its credentials.

.Additional resources

* xref:con-mutual-tls-authentication-deployment-configuration-kafka[When to use mutual TLS authentication for clients]
* xref:con-scram-sha-authentication-deployment-configuration-kafka[When to use SCRAM-SHA Authentication authentication for clients]

=== TLS Client Authentication

To use TLS client authentication, you set the `type` field to `tls`.

.An example `KafkaUser` with TLS client authentication enabled
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaUserApiVersion}
kind: KafkaUser
metadata:
  name: my-user
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:
  authentication:
    type: tls
  # ...
----

When the user is created by the User Operator, it creates a new Secret with the same name as the `KafkaUser` resource.
The Secret contains a private and public key for TLS client authentication.
The public key is contained in a user certificate, which is signed by the client Certificate Authority (CA).

All keys are in X.509 format.

Secrets provide private keys and certificates in PEM and PKCS #12 formats.
For more information on securing Kafka communication with Secrets, see xref:security-{context}[].

  user.key: # Private key of the user
  user.p12: # PKCS #12 archive file for storing certificates and keys
  user.password: # Password for protecting the PKCS #12 archive file
----

=== SCRAM-SHA-512 Authentication

To use SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication mechanism, you set the `type` field to `scram-sha-512`.

metadata:
  name: my-user
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:
  authentication:
    type: scram-sha-512
  # ...
----

When the user is created by the User Operator, it creates a new secret with the same name as the `KafkaUser` resource.
The secret contains the generated password in the `password` key, which is encoded with base64.
In order to use the password, it must be decoded.

.An example `Secret` with user credentials
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]

apiVersion: v1

metadata:

type: Opaque
data:
  password: Z2VuZXJhdGVkcGFzc3dvcmQ= # Generated password
----

Decoding the generated password:

echo "Z2VuZXJhdGVkcGFzc3dvcmQ=" | base64 --decode

[id='simple-acl-{context}']
== User authorization

User authorization is configured using the `authorization` property in `KafkaUser.spec`.
The authorization type enabled for a user is specified using the `type` field.

If no authorization is specified, the User Operator does not provision any access rights for the user.

To use simple authorization, you set the `type` property to `simple` in `KafkaUser.spec`.
Simple authorization uses the default Kafka authorization plugin, `SimpleAclAuthorizer`.

Alternatively, if you are using OAuth 2.0 token based authentication, you can also xref:assembly-oauth-authorization_str[configure OAuth 2.0 authorization].

[discrete]
=== ACL rules

`SimpleAclAuthorizer` uses ACL rules to manage access to Kafka brokers.

ACL rules grant access rights to the user, which you specify in the `acls` property.

An `AclRule` is specified as a set of properties:

`resource`:: The `resource` property specifies the resource that the rule applies to.
+
--
Simple authorization supports four resource types, which are specified in the `type` property:

* Topics (`topic`)
* Consumer Groups (`group`)
* Clusters (`cluster`)
* Transactional IDs (`transactionalId`)
--
+
For Topic, Group, and Transactional ID resources you can specify the name of the resource the rule applies to in the `name` property.
+
Cluster type resources have no name.
+
A name is specified as a `literal` or a `prefix` using the `patternType` property.
+
* Literal names are taken exactly as they are specified in the `name` field.
* Prefix names use the value from the `name` as a prefix, and will apply the rule to all resources with names starting with the value.

`type`::
The `type` property specifies the type of ACL rule, `allow` or `deny`.
+
The `type` field is optional.
If `type` is unspecified, the ACL rule is treated as an `allow` rule.

`operation`:: The `operation` specifies the operation to allow or deny.
+
--
The following operations are supported:

* Read
* Write
* Delete
* Alter
* Describe
* All
* IdempotentWrite
* ClusterAction
* Create
* AlterConfigs
* DescribeConfigs
--
+
Only certain operations work with each resource.
+
For more details about `SimpleAclAuthorizer`, ACLs and supported combinations of resources and operations, see link:http://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security_authz[Authorization and ACLs^].

`host`:: The `host` property specifies a remote host from which the rule is allowed or denied.
+
Use an asterisk (`\*`) to allow or deny the operation from all hosts.
The `host` field is optional. If `host` is unspecified, the `*` value is used by default.

For more information about the `AclRule` object, see xref:type-AclRule-reference[`AclRule` schema reference].

          name: my-group
          patternType: prefix
        operation: Read
----

=== Super user access to Kafka brokers

If a user is added to a list of super users in a Kafka broker configuration, the user is allowed unlimited access to the cluster regardless of any authorization constraints defined in ACLs.

For more information on configuring super users, see xref:assembly-kafka-authentication-and-authorization-deployment-configuration-kafka[authentication and authorization of Kafka brokers].

== User quotas

You can configure the `spec` for the `KafkaUser` resource to enforce quotas so that a user does not exceed access to Kafka brokers based on a byte threshold or a time limit of CPU utilization.

    consumerByteRate: 2097152 <2>
    requestPercentage: 55 <3>
----
<1> Byte-per-second quota on the amount of data the user can push to a Kafka broker
<2> Byte-per-second quota on the amount of data the user can fetch from a Kafka broker
<3> CPU utilization limit as a percentage of time for a client group

For more information on these properties, see the xref:type-KafkaUserQuotas-reference[`KafkaUserQuotas` schema reference]
