= Grafana

Grafana uses the metrics data exposed by Prometheus to present dashboard visualizations for monitoring.

A deployment of Grafana is required, with Prometheus added as a data source.
Example dashboards, supplied with Strimzi as JSON files, are imported through the Grafana interface to present monitoring data.
