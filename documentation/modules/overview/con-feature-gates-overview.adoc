= Feature gates in Strimzi Operators

You can enable and disable some features of Operators using _feature gates_. 
When enabled, a feature gate alters the behavior of the relevant Operator.

Feature gates are set in the Operator configuration and have three stages of maturity: alpha, beta, or General Availability (GA).

For more information, see link:{BookURLUsing}#ref-operator-cluster-feature-gates-str[Feature gates] in the _Using Strimzi_ guide.
