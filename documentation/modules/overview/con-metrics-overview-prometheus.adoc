= Prometheus

Prometheus can extract metrics data from Kafka, Kafka Connect and ZooKeeper.

In order to use Prometheus to obtain metrics data and provide notifications, Prometheus and the Prometheus Alertmanager plugin must be deployed.
Kafka resources must also be deployed or redeployed with Prometheus configuration to expose the metrics data.

Prometheus scrapes the exposed metrics data for monitoring.
Alertmanager issues notifications on conditions that indicate potential issues based on pre-defined alerting rules.

Sample metrics and alerting rules configuration files are provided with Strimzi.
The sample alerting mechanism provided with Strimzi is configured to send notifications to a Slack channel.
