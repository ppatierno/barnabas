= Consumer group identifier

Use the `consumer.groupId` property to configure a consumer group identifier for the consumer.

Kafka MirrorMaker uses a Kafka consumer to consume messages, behaving like any other Kafka consumer client.
Messages consumed from the source Kafka cluster are mirrored to a target Kafka cluster.
A group identifier is required, as the consumer needs to be part of a consumer group for the assignment of partitions.
