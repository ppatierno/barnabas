= Requests to the Kafka Bridge

Specify data formats and HTTP headers to ensure valid requests are submitted to the Kafka Bridge.

API request and response bodies are always encoded as JSON.

== Content Type headers

A `Content-Type` header must be submitted with all requests. The only exception is for consumer operations where the `POST` request body is empty. In this case, requests sent with a `Content-Type` header will fail because the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) does not validate the request.

Consumer operations (`/consumers` endpoints) and producer operations (`/topics` endpoints) require different `Content-Type` headers.

.Content-Type headers for consumer operations

Regardless of the link:#embedded-data-format[embedded data format], `POST` requests for consumer operations must provide the following `Content-Type` header if the request body contains data: 

[source,http,subs=+quotes]
----
Content-Type: application/vnd.kafka.v2+json
----

.Content-Type headers for producer operations

When performing producer operations, `POST` requests must provide the following `Content-Type` header specifying the desired __embedded data format__, either `json` or `binary`, as shown in the following table.

[%autowidth,cols="2*",options="header",stripes="none",separator=¦]
|===

¦Embedded data format
¦Content-Type header

¦JSON
m¦Content-Type: application/vnd.kafka.json.v2+json

¦Binary
m¦Content-Type: application/vnd.kafka.binary.v2+json

|===

You set the embedded data format when creating a consumer using the `consumers/{groupid}` endpoint--for more information, see the next section.

The `Content-Type` must not be set if the `POST` request has an empty body.
An empty body can be used to create a consumer with the default values.

[#embedded-data-format]
== Embedded data format

The embedded data format is the format of the Kafka messages that are transmitted, over HTTP, from a producer to a consumer using the Kafka Bridge. Two embedded data formats are supported: JSON or binary.

When creating a consumer using the `/consumers/{groupid}` endpoint, the `POST` request body must specify an embedded data format of either JSON or binary. This is specified in the `format` field in the request body, for example:

[source,json,subs=attributes+]
----
{
  "name": "my-consumer",
  "format": "binary", <1>
...
}
----

<1> A binary embedded data format.

If an embedded data format for the consumer is not specified, then a binary format is set.

The embedded data format specified when creating a consumer must match the data format of the Kafka messages it will consume. 

If you choose to specify a binary embedded data format, subsequent producer requests must provide the binary data in the request body as Base64-encoded strings. For example, when sending messages by making `POST` requests to the `/topics/{topicname}` endpoint, the `value` must be encoded in Base64:

[source,json,subs=attributes+]
----
{
  "records": [
    {
      "key": "my-key",
      "value": "ZWR3YXJkdGhldGhyZWVsZWdnZWRjYXQ="
    },    
  ]
}
----

Producer requests must also provide a `Content-Type` header that corresponds to the embedded data format, for example, `Content-Type: application/vnd.kafka.binary.v2+json`.

== Accept headers

After creating a consumer, all subsequent GET requests must provide an `Accept` header in the following format:

[source,http,subs=+quotes]
----
Accept: application/vnd.kafka.<embedded-data-format>.v2+json
----

The <embedded-data-format> is either `json` or `binary`.

For example, when retrieving records for a subscribed consumer using an embedded data format of JSON, include this Accept header:

[source,http,subs=+quotes]
----
Accept: application/vnd.kafka.json.v2+json
----
