= Overview of OpenTracing and Jaeger

Strimzi uses the OpenTracing and Jaeger projects.

The OpenTracing specification defines APIs that developers can use to instrument applications for distributed tracing. It is independent from the tracing system.

When instrumented, applications generate _traces_ for individual transactions. Traces are composed of _spans_, which define specific units of work.

Jaeger is a tracing system that provides client libraries for instrumenting applications. It implements the OpenTracing APIs. Use the Jaeger user interface to visualize, query, filter, and analyze trace data:
