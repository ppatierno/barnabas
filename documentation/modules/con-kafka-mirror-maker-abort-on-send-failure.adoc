= Abort on message send failure

Use the `producer.abortOnSendFailure` property to configure how to handle message send failure from the producer.

By default, if an error occurs when sending a message from Kafka MirrorMaker to a Kafka cluster:

* The Kafka MirrorMaker container is terminated in Kubernetes.
* The container is then recreated.

If the `abortOnSendFailure` option is set to `false`, message sending errors are ignored.
