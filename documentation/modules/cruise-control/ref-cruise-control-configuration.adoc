= Cruise Control configuration

The `config` property in `Kafka.spec.cruiseControl` contains configuration options as keys with values as one of the following JSON types:

* String
* Number
* Boolean

NOTE: Strings that look like JSON or YAML will need to be explicitly quoted.

You can specify and configure all the options listed in the "Configurations" section of the {CruiseControlConfigDocs}, apart from those managed directly by {ProductName}.
Specifically, you *cannot* modify configuration options with keys equal to or starting with one of the following strings:

* `bootstrap.servers`
* `zookeeper.`
* `ssl.`
* `security.`
* `failed.brokers.zk.path`
* `webserver.http.port`
* `webserver.http.address`
* `webserver.api.urlprefix`
* `metric.reporter.sampler.bootstrap.servers`
* `metric.reporter.topic`
* `metric.reporter.topic.pattern`
* `partition.metric.sample.store.topic`
* `broker.metric.sample.store.topic`
* `capacity.config.file`
* `skip.sample.store.topic.rack.awareness.check`
* `cruise.control.metrics.topic`
* `sasl.`

If restricted options are specified, they are ignored and a warning message is printed to the Cluster Operator log file.
All supported options are passed to Cruise Control.

== Capacity configuration

Cruise Control uses capacity limits to determine if goals related to broker resources are being violated.
A violation of a goal can cause a optimization to fail, preventing that optimization from being used to generate a partition rebalance proposal.
For example, an optimization that would cause a broker to exceed its CPU capacity would not be used for when the CpuCapacityGoal is set as a hard goal.

Capacity limits for broker resources can be specified in the `brokerCapacity` property in `Kafka.spec.cruiseControl`.
Capacity limits can be set for the following broker resources in the described units:

* `disk`  - Disk storage in MiB
* `cpuUtilization`   - CPU utilization as a percent (0-100)
* `inboundNetwork`  - Network inbound throughput in KiB/s
* `outboundNetwork` - Newtork outbound throughput in KiB/s

Since {ProductName} brokers are homogeneous, Cruise Control will apply the same capacity limits to every broker it is monitoring.
