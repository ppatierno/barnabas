= Optimization proposals overview

An _optimization proposal_ is a summary of proposed changes that would produce a more balanced Kafka cluster, with partition workloads distributed more evenly among the brokers. 
Each optimization proposal is based on the set of xref:con-optimization-goals-{context}[optimization goals] that were used to generate it.

Optimization proposals always satisfy all the configured hard goals, although not necessarily all the soft goals. Hard goals are ignored if `skip_hard_goal_check: true` is specified in the `KafkaRebalance` custom resource.

An optimization proposal contains the following information, in JSON, about the pending cluster rebalance:

* An optimal mapping of partitions to brokers, generated by the Analyzer component of Cruise Control

* Changes to the partition leaders

* Statistics on the cluster rebalance (before and after)

You can use the information to decide whether to implement the cluster rebalance, or change the optimization goals. 

NOTE: All optimization proposals are dry runs: you cannot implement a cluster rebalance without first generating an optimization proposal. 
There is no limit to the number of optimization proposals that can be generated.
