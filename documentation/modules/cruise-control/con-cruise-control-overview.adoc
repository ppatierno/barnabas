Brokers in a Kafka cluster can become unevenly loaded for many reasons.
For example, partitions that handle large amounts of message traffic can be unevenly distributed across the available brokers.
Monitoring this broker load and reassigning busy partitions to brokers with spare capacity is time consuming and adds to the overhead of managing a Kafka cluster.

Cruise Control helps to automate the monitoring and rebalancing of partitions across a Kafka cluster.
When deployed to a Kubernetes cluster that contains a Kafka cluster, Cruise Control performs the following cluster balancing tasks:

* Monitoring the CPU, disk, and network load of Kafka brokers.
* Generating optimization proposals: balanced partition assignments based on configurable optimization goals.
* Executing partition reassignments based on optimization proposals.
