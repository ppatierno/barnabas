= Implementing an optimization proposal

You can implement an xref:con-optimization-proposals-{context}[optimization proposal] if its status is `ProposalReady`.
Cruise Control will then reassign partitions to brokers and change partition leadership, as summarized in the optimization proposal.

[CAUTION]
====
*This is not a dry run.* Before you implement an optimization proposal, you must:

* Refresh the proposal in case it has become out of date.
* Carefully review the link:#contents-optimization-proposals[contents of the proposal].
====

.Prerequisites

* You have xref:proc-generating-optimization-proposals-{context}[generated an optimization proposal].

* The optimization proposal is ready to implement (the `KafkaRebalance` custom resource status is `ProposalReady`).

.Procedure

Perform these steps for the optimization proposal that you want to implement:

. Unless the optimization proposal is newly generated, we recommend you validate that it is based on current information about the state of the Kafka cluster.
To do so, refresh the optimization proposal to make sure it uses the latest cluster metrics:

.. Annotate the `KafkaRebalance` resource in Kubernetes:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
kubectl annotate kafkarebalance _cluster-rebalance-name_ strimzi.io/rebalance=refresh
----

.. Check the status of the `KafkaRebalance` resource:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
kubectl describe kafkarebalance _rebalance-cr-name_
----

.. Wait until the status changes to `ProposalReady`.

. Approve the optimization proposal that you want to implement.
+
Annotate the `KafkaRebalance` resource in Kubernetes:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
kubectl annotate kafkarebalance _cluster-rebalance-name_ strimzi.io/rebalance=approve
----

. The Cluster Operator detects the annotated resource and instructs Cruise Control to rebalance the Kafka cluster.

. Check the status of the `KafkaRebalance` resource:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
kubectl describe kafkarebalance _rebalance-cr-name_
----

. Cruise Control returns one of three statuses:

** Rebalancing: The cluster rebalance operation is in progress. 

** Ready: The cluster rebalancing operation completed successfully.

** NotReady: An error occurred--see xref:proc-fixing-problems-with-kafkarebalance-{context}[].
