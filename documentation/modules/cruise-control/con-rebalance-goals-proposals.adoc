= Optimization goals and proposals

To rebalance a Kafka cluster, Cruise Control uses _optimization goals_ to generate _optimization proposals_. 

[discrete]
== Optimization goals

Optimization goals specify targets for workload redistribution and resource utilization across a Kafka cluster.
There are two basic types:

* _Default optimization goals_, set in the `Kafka` resource on deployment and updated as needed. These goals are required.

* _User-provided optimization goals_, set in `KafkaRebalance` resources on an ad hoc basis. These goals are optional.

For both types of optimization goals, you can define a subset as _hard goals_ that must be satisfied in optimization proposals. Goals not designated as hard goals are treated as _soft goals_.

[discrete]
=== Supported optimization goals

With a few exceptions, all optimization goals in the Kafka Cruise Control project are supported.
These are as follows, in descending priority order:

. Rack-awareness
. Replica capacity
. Capacity
.. Disk capacity
.. Network inbound capacity
.. Network outbound capacity
//.. CPU capacity
. Replica distribution
. Potential network output
. Resource distribution
.. Disk utilization distribution
.. Network inbound utilization distribution
.. Network outbound utilization distribution
//.. CPU utilization distribution
. Leader bytes-in rate distribution
. Topic replica distribution
. Leader replica distribution
. Preferred leader election
//. Intra-broker disk capacity
//. Intra-broker disk usage distribution   

For information on the purpose of each optimization goal, see link:https://github.com/linkedin/cruise-control/wiki/Pluggable-Components#goals[Goals^] in the Cruise Control Wiki.

NOTE: "Write your own" goals, Kafka assigner goals, and Anomaly Detector are not supported.

You can customize the optimization goals by reordering them in terms of priority, and disabling goals to exclude from optimization proposal calculations.

[id="default-custom-goals"]
[discrete]
=== Default and user-provided optimization goals

When interacting with Cruise Control, you can use the _default optimization goals_, which are defined in the Cruise Control deployment configuration, or set ad hoc _user-provided optimization goals_. 

The *default optimization goals* are set in the `Kafka` custom resource. 
You specify a list of goals in `spec.cruiseControl.config.default.goals`.

Unless you set user-provided optimization goals, the default optimization goals are used by Cruise Control to return the _cached optimization proposal_. 
The cached proposal reflects the current state of the Kafka cluster and is updated every 15 minutes by default. 

To review the list of default goals, see link:https://github.com/linkedin/cruise-control/wiki/Configurations#analyzer-configurations[Analyzer Configurations^] in the Cruise Control Wiki.

For more information on setting the default optimization goals, see xref:ref-cruise-control-configuration-{context}[]. 

*User-provided optimization goals* are set in the `spec.goals` section of a `KafkaRebalance` resource and override the default optimization goals. 
If no user-provided optimization goals are set, the default optimization goals are used.

User-provided optimization goals can generate an optimization proposal that addresses a particular scenario.
For example, you might want to optimize leader replica distribution across the Kafka cluster without considering other goals, such as disk or CPU usage. 
So, you create a `KafkaRebalance` resource containing a custom optimization goal for leader replica distribution only.

It is often faster to generate optimization proposals based on user-provided rather than default optimization goals.
User-provided optimization goals must always be a subset of the default optimization goals.

For more information on setting user-provided optimization goals, see xref:proc-generating-rebalance-proposals-{context}[].

=== Soft goals and hard goals

The following table explains the differences between soft and hard goals in cluster rebalance calculations:

¦Optimization goal type
¦Description
¦Example

¦Soft goals

¦Also known as _best effort_ goals, soft goals do _not_ need to be satisfied in optimization proposals. 
However, they are included in optimization calculations.
An optimization proposal that violates one or more soft goals but satisfies all hard goals is valid.

Optimization goals are treated as soft goals unless they are designated as hard goals

¦Attempt to distribute a topic's replicas evenly across the cluster (topic replica distribution goal). 
Ignore this goal if doing so will enable all hard goals to be met.

¦Hard goals

¦Hard goals _must_ be satisfied in optimization proposals (unless the `skip_hard_goal_check` option is specified).
In other words, an optimization proposal that does _not_ satisfy all the designated hard goals is rejected by Cruise Control and not sent to the user.

Designating hard goals is optional.
¦All brokers in the cluster must have fewer than 3 replicas (replica capacity goal).

[discrete]
== Optimization proposals

An _optimization proposal_ is a summary of proposed changes from Cruise Control that would produce a more balanced Kafka cluster, with partition workloads distributed more evenly across the brokers. 
Each optimization proposal is based on the set of optimization goals (either default goals or user-provided goals) that were used to generate it.

Optimization proposals always satisfy all the supplied hard goals, though not necessarily all the supplied soft goals. Hard goals are ignored if the `skip_hard_goal_check` option is specified.

An optimization proposal provides the following information in JSON:

* An optimal mapping of partitions to brokers, generated by the Analyzer component of Cruise Control

* Statistics on the cluster rebalance (before and after)

You can use the information to decide whether to implement the cluster rebalance, or change the optimization goals. 

All optimization proposals are dry runs: you cannot implement a cluster rebalance without first generating an optimization proposal. 
There is no limit to the number of optimization proposals that can be generated.
