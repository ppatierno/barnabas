= Deployment prerequisites

To deploy Strimzi, make sure:

ifdef::Downloading[]
* A Kubernetes {KubernetesVersion} cluster is available
endif::Downloading[]
ifndef::Downloading[]
* An OpenShift {OpenShiftVersion} cluster is available
+
Strimzi is based on Strimzi {StrimziVersion}.
endif::Downloading[]
* The `kubectl` command-line tool is installed and configured to connect to the running cluster.

NOTE: Strimzi supports some features that are specific to OpenShift,
where such integration benefits OpenShift users and there is no equivalent implementation using standard Kubernetes.
