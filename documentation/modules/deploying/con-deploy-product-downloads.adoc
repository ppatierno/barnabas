Strimzi release artifacts include sample YAML files to help you deploy the components of Strimzi to Kubernetes, perform common operations,
and configure your Kafka cluster.

You deploy Strimzi to a Kubernetes cluster using the `kubectl` command-line tool.

NOTE: Additionally, Strimzi container images are available through the {DockerRepository}.
However, we recommend that you use the YAML files provided to deploy Strimzi.
