= Consumer streams

Use the `consumer.numStreams` property to configure the number of streams for the consumer.

You can increase the throughput in mirroring topics by increasing the number of consumer threads.
Consumer threads belong to the consumer group specified for Kafka MirrorMaker.
Topic partitions are assigned across the consumer threads, which consume messages in parallel.
