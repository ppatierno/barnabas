= Configuring SASL authentication in Kafka MirrorMaker

.Prerequisites

* Source and target Kafka clusters are available
* A running Cluster Operator with a `listener` configured for SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication
* Username to be used for authentication
* If they exist, the name of the `Secret` with the password used for authentication, and the key under which it is stored in the `Secret`

.Procedure

As the Kafka MirrorMaker connects to two Kafka clusters (source and target), you can choose to configure SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication for one or both of the clusters.
The following steps describe how to configure SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication on the consumer side for connecting to the source Kafka cluster.

If you want to use SASL PLAIN authentication, the steps are the same as shown here but you set the `authentication.type` property to `plain`.

. (Optional) If they do not already exist, prepare a file with the password used for authentication and create the `Secret`:
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
echo -n '_<password>_' > _<my-password.txt>_
kubectl create secret generic _<my-secret>_ --from-file=_<my-password.txt>_
+
NOTE: Secrets created by the User Operator may be used.

. Edit the `KafkaMirrorMaker.spec.consumer.authentication` property.

----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: KafkaMirrorMaker
metadata:
  name: my-mirror-maker
spec:
  # ...
  consumer:
    authentication:
      type: scram-sha-512
      username: my-source-user
      passwordSecret:
        secretName: my-source-user
        password: my-source-password-key
  # ...
  producer:
    authentication:
      type: scram-sha-512
      username: my-producer-user
      passwordSecret:
        secretName: my-producer-user
        password: my-producer-password-key
  # ...
----
+
IMPORTANT: Do not specify the actual password in the `password` field.

. Create or update the resource:
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
kubectl apply -f _<your-file>_

Repeat the above steps for configuring SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication on the target Kafka cluster.
In this case, the secret containing the certificate has to be configured in the `KafkaMirrorMaker.spec.producer.authentication` property.
