= Performing a restart of a Kafka MirrorMaker 2.0 connector task

This procedure describes how to manually trigger a restart of a Kafka MirrorMaker 2.0 connector task by using a Kubernetes annotation.

.Prerequisites

* The Cluster Operator is running.

.Procedure

. Find the name of the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` custom resource that controls the Kafka MirrorMaker 2.0 connector you want to restart:
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
kubectl get KafkaMirrorMaker2

. Find the name of the Kafka MirrorMaker 2.0 connector and the ID of the task to be restarted from the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` custom resource.
Task IDs are non-negative integers, starting from 0:
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
kubectl describe KafkaMirrorMaker2 _KafkaMirrorMaker2-name_

. To restart the connector task, annotate the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` resource in Kubernetes.
For example, using `kubectl annotate` to restart task 0 of the connector named `my-source->my-target.MirrorSourceConnector`:
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
kubectl annotate KafkaMirrorMaker2 _KafkaMirrorMaker2-name_ "strimzi.io/restart-connector-task=my-source->my-target.MirrorSourceConnector:0"

. Wait for the next reconciliation to occur (every two minutes by default).
The Kafka MirrorMaker 2.0 connector task is restarted, as long as the annotation was detected by the reconciliation process.
When the restart task request is accepted, the annotation is removed from the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` custom resource.
