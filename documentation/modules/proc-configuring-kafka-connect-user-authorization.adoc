= Configuring Kafka Connect user authorization

This procedure describes how to authorize user access to Kafka Connect.

When any type of authorization is being used in Kafka, a Kafka Connect user requires access rights to the consumer group
and the internal topics of Kafka Connect.

This procedure shows how access is provided when `simple` authorization is being used.

Simple authorization uses ACL rules, handled by the Kafka `SimpleAclAuthorizer` plugin, to provide the right level of access.
For more information on configuring a `KafkaUser` resource to use simple authorization, see xref:ref-operator-user-str[Kafka User resource].

NOTE: The default values for the consumer group and topics will differ when xref:con-kafka-connect-multiple-instances-{context}[running multiple instances].

.Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes cluster
* A running Cluster Operator

.Procedure

. Edit the `authorization` property in the `KafkaUser` resource to provide access rights to the user.
+
In the following example, access rights are configured for the Kafka Connect topics and consumer group using `literal` name values:
+
[table,stripes=none]
|===
|Property |Name

|`offset.storage.topic`
|`connect-cluster-offsets`

|`status.storage.topic`
|`connect-cluster-status`

|`config.storage.topic`
|`connect-cluster-configs`

|`group`
|`connect-cluster`
