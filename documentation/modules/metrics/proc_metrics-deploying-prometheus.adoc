= Deploying Prometheus

To obtain monitoring data in your Kafka cluster,
you can use your own Prometheus deployment or deploy Prometheus by applying the xref:ref-metrics-config-files-{context}[example resource file for the Prometheus docker image and the YAML files for Prometheus-related resources].

The deployment process creates a `ClusterRoleBinding` and discovers an Alertmanager instance in the namespace specified for the deployment.

NOTE: By default, the Prometheus Operator only supports jobs that include an `endpoints` role for service discovery. Targets are discovered and scraped for each endpoint port address. For endpoint discovery, the port address may be derived from service (`role: service`) or pod (`role: pod`) discovery.

.Prerequisites

* Check the xref:ref-metrics-alertmanager-examples-{context}[example alerting rules provided]

.Procedure

. Modify the Prometheus installation file (`prometheus.yaml`) according to the namespace Prometheus is going to be installed into:
+
On Linux, use:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
sed -i 's/namespace: .*/namespace: _my-namespace_/' prometheus.yaml
+
On MacOS, use:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
sed -i '' 's/namespace: .*/namespace: _my-namespace_/' prometheus.yaml

. Edit the `PodMonitor` resource in `strimzi-pod-monitor.yaml` to define Prometheus jobs that will scrape the metrics data from pods.
`PodMonitor` is used to scrape data directly from pods and is used for Apache Kafka, ZooKeeper, Operators, and Kafka Bridge. Update the `namespaceSelector.matchNames` property with the namespace where the pods to scrape the metrics from are running.

. The Grafana dashboards provided show metrics for CPU, memory and disk volume usage, which come directly from the Kubernetes cAdvisor agent and kubelet on the nodes.
An additional configuration is needed because the Prometheus operator does not have something like `PodMonitor` for scraping metrics directly from nodes.

.. Create a `Secret` resource:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
kubectl create secret generic additional-scrape-configs --from-file=prometheus-additional.yaml

.. Edit the `additionalScrapeConfigs` property in the `prometheus.yaml` file to include the name of the `Secret` and the YAML file (`prometheus-additional.yaml`) that contains the additional configuration.

. Deploy the Prometheus resources:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
kubectl apply -f strimzi-pod-monitor.yaml
kubectl apply -f prometheus-rules.yaml
kubectl apply -f prometheus.yaml
