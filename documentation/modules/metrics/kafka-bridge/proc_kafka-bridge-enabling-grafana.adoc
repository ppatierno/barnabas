= Enabling the Kafka Bridge Grafana dashboard

If you deployed Kafka Bridge with your Kafka cluster, you can enable Grafana to present the metrics data it exposes.

A Kafka Bridge dashboard is provided in the `examples/metrics` directory as a JSON file:

* `strimzi-kafka-bridge.json`

.Prerequisites

* Kafka Bridge is deployed with xref:proc-kafka-bridge-configuring-{context}[Kafka Bridge metrics configuration]
* xref:assembly-metrics-prometheus-{context}[Prometheus and Prometheus Alertmanager are deployed to the Kafka cluster]
* xref:proc-metrics-deploying-grafana-{context}[Grafana is deployed to the Kafka cluster]

This procedure assumes you already have access to the Grafana user interface and Prometheus has been added as a data source.
If you are accessing the user interface for the first time, see xref:assembly-metrics-grafana-{context}[Grafana].

.Procedure

. xref:proc-metrics-grafana-dashboard-{context}[Access the Grafana user interface].

. Select the _Kafka Bridge_ dashboard.

When metrics data has been collected for some time, the Kafka Bridge charts are populated.

+
* HTTP connections to the Kafka Bridge count
