= Container images

Use the `image` property to configure the container image used by the component.

Overriding container images is recommended only in special situations where you need to use a different container registry or a customized image.

For example, if your network does not allow access to the container repository used by Strimzi, you can copy the Strimzi images or build them from the source.
However, if the configured image is not compatible with Strimzi images, it might not work properly.

A copy of the container image might also be customized and used for debugging.

For more information see xref:ref-configuring-container-images-deployment-configuration-kafka[Container image configurations].
