= Certificate Authorities

To support encryption, each {ProductName} component needs its own private keys and public key certificates.
All component certificates are signed by an internal Certificate Authority (CA) called the _cluster CA_.

Similarly, each Kafka client application connecting to {ProductName} using TLS client authentication needs to provide private keys and certificates.
A second CA, named the _clients CA_, is used to sign certificates for the Kafka clients. 

If you need to use certificates signed by an external CA, you can configure Kafka broker certificates on a per-listener basis.

== CA certificates

Both the cluster CA and the clients CA have a self-signed public key certificate.

Kafka brokers are configured to trust certificates signed by either the clients CA or the cluster CA. Components that clients do not need to connect to, such as ZooKeeper, only trust certificates signed by the cluster CA. Client applications that perform mutual TLS authentication have to trust the certificates signed by the cluster CA.

By default, {ProductName} generates and renews CA certificates automatically. You can configure the management of CA certificates in the `Kafka.spec.clusterCa` and `Kafka.spec.clientsCa` objects.

== Validity periods

CA certificate validity periods are expressed as a number of days after certificate generation.
You can configure the validity period of:

* Cluster CA certificates in `Kafka.spec.clusterCa.validityDays`
* Client CA certificates in `Kafka.spec.clientsCa.validityDays`
