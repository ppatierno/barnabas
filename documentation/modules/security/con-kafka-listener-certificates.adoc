= Kafka listener certificates

In order to connect to external systems such as {ProductName}, your client applications might need to trust server certificates that were issued by an external CA, such as your company's private CA or a public CA.
To support this requirement, {ProductName} allows you to provide your own _Kafka listener certificates_ and public keys for external listeners which have TLS encryption enabled.
Your Kafka client applications will connect to Kafka brokers using Kafka listener certificates rather than CA certificates signed by the cluster CA or clients CA.

You can also provide your own Kafka listener certificates for TLS listeners.

You must manually renew Kafka listener certificates when needed.
