= Prometheus metrics

{ProductName} operators expose Prometheus metrics.
The metrics are automatically enabled and contain information about:

* Number of reconciliations
* Number of Custom Resources the operator is processing
* Duration of reconciliations
* JVM metrics from the operators

Additionally, we provide an example Grafana dashboard.

For more information about Prometheus, see the xref:assembly-metrics-setup-{context}[introduction to metrics].
