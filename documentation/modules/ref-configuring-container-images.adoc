= Container image configurations

You can specify which container image to use for each component using the `image` property in the following resources:

* `Kafka.spec.kafka`
* `Kafka.spec.kafka.tlsSidecar`
* `Kafka.spec.zookeeper`
* `Kafka.spec.zookeeper.tlsSidecar`
* `Kafka.spec.entityOperator.topicOperator`
* `Kafka.spec.entityOperator.userOperator`
* `Kafka.spec.entityOperator.tlsSidecar`
* `Kafka.spec.jmxTrans`
* `KafkaConnect.spec`
* `KafkaConnectS2I.spec`
* `KafkaBridge.spec`

== Configuring the `image` property for Kafka, Kafka Connect, and Kafka MirrorMaker

Kafka, Kafka Connect (including Kafka Connect with S2I support), and Kafka MirrorMaker support multiple versions of Kafka.
Each component requires its own image.
The default images for the different Kafka versions are configured in the following environment variables:

* `STRIMZI_KAFKA_IMAGES`
* `STRIMZI_KAFKA_CONNECT_IMAGES`
* `STRIMZI_KAFKA_CONNECT_S2I_IMAGES`
* `STRIMZI_KAFKA_MIRROR_MAKER_IMAGES`

These environment variables contain mappings between the Kafka versions and their corresponding images.
The mappings are used together with the `image` and `version` properties:

* If neither `image` nor `version` are given in the custom resource then the `version` will default to the Cluster Operator's default Kafka version, and the image will be the one corresponding to this version in the environment variable.

* If `image` is given but `version` is not, then the given image is used and the `version` is assumed to be the Cluster Operator's default Kafka version.

* If `version` is given but `image` is not, then the image that corresponds to the given version in the environment variable is used.

* If both `version` and `image` are given, then the given image is used. The image is assumed to contain a Kafka image with the given version.

The `image` and `version` for the different components can be configured in the following properties:

* For Kafka in `spec.kafka.image` and `spec.kafka.version`.
* For Kafka Connect, Kafka Connect S2I, and Kafka MirrorMaker in `spec.image` and `spec.version`.

WARNING: It is recommended to provide only the `version` and leave the `image` property unspecified.
This reduces the chance of making a mistake when configuring the custom resource. 
If you need to change the images used for different versions of Kafka, it is preferable to configure the Cluster Operator's environment variables.

== Configuring the `image` property in other resources

For the `image` property in the other custom resources, the given value will be used during deployment.
If the `image` property is missing, the `image` specified in the Cluster Operator configuration will be used.
If the `image` name is not defined in the Cluster Operator configuration, then the default value will be used.

* For Kafka broker TLS sidecar:
. Container image specified in the `STRIMZI_DEFAULT_TLS_SIDECAR_KAFKA_IMAGE` environment variable from the Cluster Operator configuration.
. `{DockerKafkaStunnel}` container image.
* For ZooKeeper nodes:
* For ZooKeeper node TLS sidecar:
. Container image specified in the `STRIMZI_DEFAULT_TLS_SIDECAR_ZOOKEEPER_IMAGE` environment variable from the Cluster Operator configuration.
. `{DockerZookeeperStunnel}` container image.
* For Topic Operator:
. Container image specified in the `STRIMZI_DEFAULT_TOPIC_OPERATOR_IMAGE` environment variable from the Cluster Operator configuration.
. `{DockerTopicOperator}` container image.
* For User Operator:
. Container image specified in the `STRIMZI_DEFAULT_USER_OPERATOR_IMAGE` environment variable from the Cluster Operator configuration.
. `{DockerUserOperator}` container image.
* For Entity Operator TLS sidecar:
. Container image specified in the `STRIMZI_DEFAULT_TLS_SIDECAR_ENTITY_OPERATOR_IMAGE` environment variable from the Cluster Operator configuration.
. `{DockerEntityOperatorStunnel}` container image.
* For Kafka Exporter:
. Container image specified in the `STRIMZI_DEFAULT_KAFKA_EXPORTER_IMAGE` environment variable from the Cluster Operator configuration.
. `{DockerKafka}` container image.
* For Kafka Bridge:
. Container image specified in the `STRIMZI_DEFAULT_KAFKA_BRIDGE_IMAGE` environment variable from the Cluster Operator configuration.
. `{DockerKafkaBridge}` container image.
* For Kafka broker initializer:
. Container image specified in the `STRIMZI_DEFAULT_KAFKA_INIT_IMAGE` environment variable from the Cluster Operator configuration.
. `{DockerKafkaInit}` container image.
* For Kafka broker initializer:
. Container image specified in the `STRIMZI_DEFAULT_JMXTRANS_IMAGE` environment variable from the Cluster Operator configuration.
. `{DockerKafkaInit}` container image.

WARNING: Overriding container images is recommended only in special situations, where you need to use a different container registry.
For example, because your network does not allow access to the container repository used by {ProductName}.
In such case, you should either copy the {ProductName} images or build them from source.
In case the configured image is not compatible with {ProductName} images, it might not work properly.
